The National Union of Mineworkers Youth Structure (NUMYS) called for all eligible voters and young people to vote for the African National Congress (ANC). "As young people, we have a responsibility to safeguard our revolution at all times and voting for the ANC made sure that our country is not sold to the highest bidder by people who have no interest for our people and the working class," says Bonginkosi Mrasi, NUMYS National Secretary. "Young people must avoid enabling mistakes individuals have made in the organisation but blame the ANC as a party," adds Mrasi.
