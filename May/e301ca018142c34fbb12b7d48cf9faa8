South African businesses have a matter of days before they face the reality of the implementation of the carbon tax and associated administration related to carbon emission tracking and management when both the Carbon Tax Act and the Customs and Excise Amendment Act take effect on 1 June 2019. President Cyril Ramaphosa assented
to the long-awaited Carbon Tax Act, 2019, which was gazetted on
23 May 2019 following his inauguration as President. In a nutshell, the Carbon Tax Act imposes a carbon tax of R120 per tCO2-eq, which will increase annually at a rate of inflation plus 2% until 31 December 2022, and in line with inflation thereafter. The carbon tax liability is
calculated as the tax base (sum of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from combustion, industrial processes and fugitive emissions in
accordance with a reporting methodology approved by the Department of Environmental
Affairs, proportionately reduced by certain tax-free allowances) multiplied by
the rate of the carbon tax. In order to facilitate carbon tax,
the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) has implemented a mandatory GHG reporting
system comprising the following regulatory mechanisms: The South African Revenue Service (SARS) will be the administrative authority to implement the tax liability assessment. SARS has published draft rules, schedules and forms for the implementation of the tax, to provide details on the envisaged tax administration, including the registration of clients, licensing of emissions facilities, carbon tax environmental levy accounting and application of allowances as rebates. The draft rules are open for
public comment until 14 June 2019. Now is the time for business to assess its risk exposure to the this new environmental law to understand the complex landscape which taxpayers will have to navigate in relation to items such as the submission and verification of accounts and collection and payment of the tax.
