The National Union of Mineworkers is outraged by China African Precious Metals' refusal to listen to the mine-workers demands. Some 69 NUM workers (55 males and 14 females) staged an underground sit-in at CAPM’s mine in Orkney, in the North West province. The workers staged the sit-in after the company angered the workers by turning down their demand of ensuring that job grading is linked to positions and workers be given a living out allowance. NUM started wage negotiations with CAPM in September 2018. NUM president Joseph Montisetse says the management of the South African
subsidiary of the company offered an 8% increase, which he says was overturned
by CAPM’s management which offered no increase. Montisetse says that after the intervention of the NUM, the management conceded on 8% with conditions that they can only link that to job grading if there is production and there will be no living out allowances. “It is this kind of arrogance by CAPM management that provoked the workers to resort to sit-in underground. "We view this behavior by CAPM as a sign of not caring about mineworkers. "Capitalists don’t value anything expect maximization of creation of wealth,” Monitisetse says. Resultantly, the NUM has called on the government, through the Department of Mineral Resources, to urgently convene a high delegation meeting between the NUM, CAPM and the Department of Mineral Resources to resolve the matter and ensure that all the workers who are underground come to the surface.
