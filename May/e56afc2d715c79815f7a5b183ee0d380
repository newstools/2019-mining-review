South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa has confirmed his new cabinet, which has reduced the size of the executive leadership team by nine. A combination of old and new faces, the good news for the South African mining sector is the re-appointment of Gwede Mantashe - who has held the position of minister of the Department of Mineral Resources since February 2018. The Department is however impacted by the president's decision to reduce cabinet positions. As such, Mantashe now fulfills the position of minister for mineral resources and energy. He will be supported by a new deputy - Bavelile Hlongwa - a new name to the mining sector. Hlongwa previously held the position of executive deputy for the National Youth Development Agency. Mantashe has delivered significant success so far in his ministerial position, concluding Mining Charter III which has been mostly regarded as a success by the industry. He will ensure further stability for the sector. How he will move forward with an additional portfolio added to his responsibilities remains to be seen. Mining Review will also report on industry's response to the news, so please visit our website regularly for the latest updates.
