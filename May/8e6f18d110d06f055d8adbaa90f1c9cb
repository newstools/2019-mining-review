Toronto-listed gold
miner Teranga Gold Corporation is on track to start commissioning its second
mine, Wahgnion, in the third quarter of this year. Located in south-west
Burkina Faso, the mine will move into production ramp-up in the fourth quarter
says Paul Chawrun, Teranga COO. “Based on our
progress to date, we expect Wahgnion will produce between 30 000 and 40 000 oz of
gold in 2019, which exceeds the original estimate of 18 000 oz released in the
October 2018 technical report.” During the first
five years of its mine life, Wahgnion is expected to increase Teranga’s current
consolidated annual gold production by approximately 50%, or more than 130 000
oz. “2019 is off to a strong start for Teranga across our portfolio, with record operational results from Sabodala, good construction progress at Wahgnion and an initial resource at Golden Hill,” says Richard Young, Teranga President and CEO. “Our 10-year-old
cornerstone asset, Sabodala, set a record for quarterly production in the first
quarter. With over 12 years of mine life remaining, Sabodala is delivering
solid free cash flow to support our growth initiatives.” “During this first quarter, we continued to make meaningful
progress towards achieving our vision of building a multi-asset, mid-tier gold
producer in West Africa,” adds Young. “By year end, we will have two gold mines in operation capable of producing between 300 000 and 350 000 oz in 2020 and generating strong free cash flows." "Golden Hill also continues to show that it has the potential to be our third gold mine. In less than two years, we have advanced it from an early-stage exploration project to an initial mineral resource estimate. Going forward, our priority is to increase the mineral resources estimate and advance Golden Hill into the feasibility stage of development.”
