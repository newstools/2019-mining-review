In a move that is likely to be welcomed by the mining industry, President Ramaphosa has appointed Gwede Mantashe as the Minister of Minerals and Energy.

As a result, South Africa gained twenty seven places under the Policy Perception Index and also made considerable gains under the overall Investment Attractiveness Index in the Frasier Institute's most recent Mining Investment Survey. However, the President's decision to combine the Ministries of Mineral Resources and Energy means that Minister Mantashe is going to have to divide his time between the mining and energy sectors.

Some of the
key challenges facing the Minister during his term are likely to be: Mining Energy 1.     Oil & gas legislation – in advocating the withdrawal of the MPRDA Amendment Bill, Minister Mantashe maintained that the oil & gas industry should be regulated separately from mining. Given the recent off shore discovery and the imminent withdrawal of the MPRDA Amendment Bill, the Minister is likely to come under pressure to produce this new legislation as a matter of urgency.
