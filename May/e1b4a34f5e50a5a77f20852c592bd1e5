ASX-listed Azumah Resources has reported exceptionally high grades and visible gold at its Kunche project as mineralisation is extended to 500 m below surface. Ghana –  Azumah Resources advises that three widely-spaced exploratory drill holes at the company’s Wa Gold Project flagship Kunche deposit in Ghana have all intersected mineralisation down to at least 500 m below surface and returned some exceptionally high grade intercepts. Notable intercepts from this first concerted phase of deep
drilling at Kunche included 0.5 m at 168.3g/t Au (over 5oz gold per tonne) from
650.5 m (KRCD855) and 0.5 m at 89.39g/t Au (nearly 3oz gold per tonne) from
613.5 m (KRCD853) with visible gold observed at 650.5 m and 613.5 m
respectively. These results raise expectations that infill drilling could identify multiple, mineralised ore shoots associated with feeder zones extending below the planned Kunche open pit mine. The holes, drilled 540 m apart for a total of 2,120 m, were specifically designed to test for repetitions and vertical extensions of the ‘main’ central mineralised ‘fluid conduit’ discovered at Kunche a year ago where hole KRC831 returned an intercept of 44m at 5.37g/t Au from 99 m, including 27 m at 7.86g/t Au from 116 m, 20m at 10.27g/t Au from 120 m and 1m at 144g/t Au from 137 m. Information will guide next drilling phase Whilst generally narrow intercepts were returned in this latest
round of drilling, the discovery of gold at these depths marks a step-change in
depth expectations for the Kunche deposit and provides considerable geological
information to guide the next phase of drilling. The next phase of drilling will infill back up towards the surface as well as probe for mineralisation to even greater depths as other examples of orogenic, structurally controlled ore deposits are known to extend to over 2 km in depth in West Africa. The confirmation of deep mineralisation at Kunche follows the recent discovery of substantial, high-grade mineralisation at the nearby Bepkong East Lode deposit. This has a drill defined strike of over 300 m and has been confirmed to extend to at least 580 m below surface. Azumah Resources managing director, Stephen Stone said, “These results raise our expectations for multiple mineralised lodes extending below the planned 1.5 km long Kunche open pit, as is the case with the recently delineated and nearby Bepkong East Lode discovery. “Given the excellent drilling results since our last Wa Gold
Project Mineral Resource upgrade in September 2018, we would expect to be able
increase the current 2.5 million ounces especially as we undertake further
exploration below and in the vicinity of existing deposits and more generally
across our vast tenure of prospective Birimian terrain, the host rocks to a
majority of West Africa’s world class gold mines.”
