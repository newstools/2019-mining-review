Dual-listed gold miner Perseus Mining has been granted
approval by its board to start construction of its third gold mine, Yaouré in
Côte d’Ivoire. With a forecast capital cost of US$265 million, Yaouré is
expected to become a large scale, low-cost gold mining operation that will form
an important part of Perseus’s asset portfolio for many years to come. The board’s affirmative decision to develop Yaouré follows
the recent granting of an Exploitation Permit by the government of Côte
d’Ivoire to Perseus’s Ivorian subsidiary, Perseus Yaouré SARL, and confirmation
of Perseus’s development funding plan that includes deploying, in part: The decision to construct is immediate, opening the way for
the execution of the engineering and supply contracts between Perseus and the
well credentialled engineering company, Lycopodium. Perseus has collaborated successfully with Lycopodium in the
past, most notably on the ahead-of-time, on-budget development of Perseus’s
Sissingué gold mine, also in Côte d’Ivoire, that was commissioned in early
2018. Perseus’s CEO and MD Jeff Quartermaine says: “When Perseus acquired Amara Mining plc in April 2016, our
primary objective was to bring Yaouré into production as soon as practical.
With the decision announced today, we have moved one step closer to achieving
this goal and in doing so, we are firmly placed on the path to achieving our
stated aim of producing more than 500 000 oz of gold at an all-in site cost of
less than $850/oz from multiple mines in several jurisdictions in West Africa.” “A large amount of effort has gone into preparation and
planning of the development of Yaouré and with the experience that our team
developed from the successful execution of the Sissingué mine development plan,
we are confident that Yaouré will also be developed on time and on budget and
in the process further establish Perseus’s reputation as a reliable and capable
developer and operator of gold mines in West Africa.”
