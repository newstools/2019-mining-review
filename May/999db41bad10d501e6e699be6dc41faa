ASX-listed lithium mine developer Birimian will change its name to Mali Lithium, to reflect its renewed focus on its Goulamina project in Mali. The company is making significant headway with the project’s
development having received an environmental permit for the project in March.
It has also lodged an Exploitation (Mining) Permit with the Mali government. Mali Lithium anticipates having a definitive feasibility
study (DFS) completed in the first quarter of next year ahead of a final
investment decision in the second half of 2020. The Goulamina project has a mineral resource of 103.2 Mt at 1.34% Li2O, suggesting a mine life of 16 years. In January this year the company appointed former CEO of Altura Mining Chris Evans as the MD of the company. Evans is an experienced project delivery and operational
management expert. He was responsible for all aspects of project development,
construction and bringing into operation Altura Mining's Pilgangoora lithium
mine. “The more work we complete on the optimisation of the
Goulamina lithium project, the more evidence we see of its potential to be a
world class hard rock lithium producer with low operating costs and an extended
mine life,” says Evans. “In the past six months, Birimian has successfully progressed the project’s economics, obtained environmental permissions and lodged the mining permit, strengthened the management and operations teams and continually engaged with our potential offtake and funding partners.” “We should complete the optimisation of the current feasibility
study for Goulamina in the third quarter of this year and look forward to
further enhancements to the project’s economics through that process,” he
concludes.
