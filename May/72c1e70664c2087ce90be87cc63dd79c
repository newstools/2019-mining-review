ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered its first+100 carat diamond for its Mothae mine in Lesotho. The stone
is a gem-quality 126 carat diamond and is the largest diamond recovered since
commercial mining operations commenced in January 2019. The diamond is also the sixth +50 carat diamond recovered since Lucapa commenced its pre-production bulk sampling programme at Mothae in 2018. It comes shortly after Lucapa and its partners recovered a 130 carat gem-quality diamond from the company’s high-value Lulo alluvial mine in Angola. Lesotho
Minister of Mining, the Honourable Keketso Sello, said the recovery of the 126
carat diamond represented another milestone for Lesotho’s highly-prospective
diamond sector. “Lesotho
is very proud of its international reputation as a producer of large and
high-quality diamonds and this latest recovery from our newest mine, Mothae,
continues to demonstrate our nation’s great potential,” said minister Sello. Lucapa MD
Stephen Wetherall said the 126 carat diamond was further proof of the large
stone and high-value nature of the Mothae kimberlite resource, which is located
within 5 km of Letseng, the world’s highest US$ per carat kimberlite diamond
mine. “We are
delighted to have recovered our first +100 carat stone so early in our
commercial mining campaign
at Mothae, along with other rare Type IIa and fancy coloured gems, and look
forward to unlocking the true value of this mine over the next decade and
beyond,” Wetherall concluded.
