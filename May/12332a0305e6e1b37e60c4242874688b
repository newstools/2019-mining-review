The 2018 safety data report, which collates the safety data of around a million workers and contractors, recorded 50 fatalities in 2018. This was a decrease from 51 fatalities in 2017 and 63 fatalities in 2016. The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and its members are committed to strengthening health and safety performance and reducing operational fatalities to zero. As part of this commitment, ICMM publishes an annual safety data report of our company members. The full report, Benchmarking 2018 Safety Data: Progress of ICMM Members, is available at www.icmm.com/safety-data-2018 This benchmarking report provides the safety data from ICMM companies for 2018 and does not include fatalities from the Brumadinho tragedy that occurred in January 2019. “Our annual safety data tragically records that 50 people lost their lives at work in 2018," says ICMM CEO, Tom Butler. "ICMM and our company members are determined to eliminate fatalities from their operations. "The single highest cause of deaths in 2018 was from mobile mining equipment which is why we are exploring collision avoidance technology in our Innovation for Cleaner, Safer Vehicles programme.” Eleven of ICMM’s 27 company members reported no fatalities in 2018 compared to eight in 2017. These were: Africa Rainbow Minerals, Barrick, Freeport McMoRan, Goldcorp, JX Nippon, Minera San Cristóbal, Minsur, Mitsubishi Materials, Newcrest, Orano, and Sumitomo. The number of hours worked across ICMM’s members increased by 16 per cent due to data being included from new company members: Minera San Cristóbal, Minsur, Newcrest and Vale. While total fatalities dropped by 2 per cent, the fatality frequency rate dropped 19 per cent from 0.027 to 0.022 fatalities per million hours worked. There was also a drop in the injury rate from 3.94 in 2017 to 3.41 despite an increase in the number of recordable injuries from 7,515 to 7,751. The report findings include: Since 2012, total recordable injuries have dropped from 13,895 to 7,751 and the total recordable injury frequency rate has dropped by 33% The report also examines incidents by country. The highest number of fatalities (14) occurred in South Africa, where 400 million hours were worked. There were six fatalities in Chile and Ghana where respectively 281 million and 51 million hours were worked. The highest fatality frequency rates were recorded in Hungary, Spain and Laos which each recorded a single fatality.
