ASX-listed Birimian, which is in the process of changing its name to Mali Lithium, has selected DRA Global to provide engineering services to optimise the process flowsheet for its Goulamina lithium project. This scope of work will include the following
deliverables: This work is key to developing and optimising the design of the process plant and to the subsequent production of a capital cost estimate to the +/-10% level of accuracy required for the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), which is due for completion in Q1, 2020. DRA has recently been involved in the execution of number of lithium studies and projects. The key personnel assigned to Birimian have been an integral part of the design and commissioning of three lithium projects in Western Australia in the last 12 months and will contribute an unrivalled combination of knowledge and experience in an area which is crucial to the success of the Goulamina lithium project.
