TSX/NYSE-listed Great Panther Mining has commissioned a supplemental modular liquid oxygen supply system at the Tucano Gold Mine in Brazil. The system is designed to allow for the processing of the higher-grade sulphide ore produced by the mine and achieve designed and budgeted gold recoveries. The supplemental oxygen has been operational since start of May 2019 and has successfully processed sulfide ore at grades as high as 2 grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) with high (94%) recoveries. The following provides a summary of the plant performance: Prior to the installation of the supplemental oxygen, Tucano was limited to processing primarily lower grade oxide material. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability to process Tucano's highest-grade sulfide materials with recovery rates exceeding planned rates. "We are very happy to successfully conclude what was probably the most important single element in the Tucano turnaround, which is ongoing and progressing well," says Great Panther  president and CEO, James Bannantine. "This is also a critical accomplishment for the new Great Panther Mining team, as we integrate our teams into one." Processing plant availability and utilization for the period of 1 May 1 to 13 May 2019 was lower than designed capacity levels to facilitate testing and optimization during the commissioning of the supplemental oxygen, and due to higher than planned maintenance of the SAG mill. As a reference, gold produced from 1 May to 13 May 2019 was based on plant utilization of 73%. Gold production is expected to increase during the month of May as the SAG mill availability improves and the mill is turned back up to full capacity. The addition of the supplemental oxygen completes the functionality of the recent plant upgrade of ball mill, thickener, additional CIL tankage and oxygen supply to handle the mine's sulfide production going forward.
