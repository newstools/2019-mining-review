The sale will be effected by the transfer of Prospect’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Prospect Cobalt (PCP), along with its associated subsidiaries and assets. The consideration for the sale is: The transaction follows the decision by Prospect Resources to scale back exploration activities, and to focus on and further advance the Arcadia Lithium Project. Sam Hosack, MD of Prospect Resources says, “The Arcadia Lithium Project in Zimbabwe is a top ten global hard rock lithium asset with strong project economics. "It is shovel ready and we are currently sourcing funding to allow us to commence development. Therefore, Arcadia will be the primary driver of shareholder value in the near future, and by divesting the company’s explorational activities in the DRC, Prospect can re-allocate capital to improving Arcadia’s project economics and moving the Project into development.”
