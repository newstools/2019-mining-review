JSE-listed Bauba Platinum has entered into a trial product sale agreement for its low grade chrome ore with Booysendal Platinum, a subsidiary of Northam Platinum. As part of the agreement, effective from April 2019, Bauba Platinum will sell 24 000 dry metric tonnes of low-grade chrome ore product to Booysendal Platinum over a period of six months. In
terms of the Agreement, Northam will process this product at its concentrator
plant and the earnings and expenses flowing from the sales of the product will
be shared between the parties. “This is a significant milestone in
Bauba’s product offering following the commissioning of its wash plant, adding
an additional revenue stream from our Moeijelijk mine,” say Bauba Platinum CEO Nick
van der Hoven.
