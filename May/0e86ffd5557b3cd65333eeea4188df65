Kangra Coal has provided safe temporary ablution facilities at Qalani Primary School to ensure its students are able to learn in a safer and healthier schooling environment. Qalani is a public school located in Saul Mkhizeville under the Mkhondo Local Municipality where Kangra, the subsidiary of Menar, has operations. Previously, the ablution facilities at the school
comprised of old pit latrines that would often overflow with raw sewerage
posing a health and safety concern for the learners. When Kangra Coal Community liaison officer Simo Yende
was made aware of the plight of the school and the safety risks posed to its
learners, he arranged for the mine to donate four mobile VIP toilets to the
school. “Kangra Coal donated the VIP toilets as a temporary
solution, while the plan is to build a proper more permanent ablution facility.
We are in discussions with our large contractors to partner with us to build
modern, permanent toilets for the school as part of their CSI spend,” says
Yende. Qalani Primary School Principal M.G. Luthuli
expressing her deep appreciation to Kangra Coal states, “The donation of the
mobile toilet units is really appreciated as they have come as a great relief
to the challenging situation that learners and staff at our school are faced
with.” Menar MD Vuslat Bayoglu emphasizes that assisting
local communities, when and wherever possible, stands at the core of Menar and
the group’s subsidiaries’ values. “Sanitation is at the heart of human dignity. We had
to intervene. We continue to strive to meaningfully uplift the lives of the
communities near to, and surrounding our operations, to ensure we leave a
positive lasting legacy,” Bayoglu concludes.
