ASX-listed Oklo Resources has announced further encouraging assay results from its Kouroufing project, located 20 km southeast of its flagship Dandoko Project in west Mali. “The new AC results from Kome have confirmed another bedrock gold discovery within our Kouroufing Project during the 2019 field season. With several other auger anomalies pending deeper drill testing, our confidence in the Project hosting multiple, high-grade gold trends is growing by the day," says  Okla MD, Simon Taylor. "Meanwhile, the current drilling program at Dandoko along the 12 km-long gold corridor is testing between Seko 2 and 3 as well as along the full length of the corridor and is continuing to provide the opportunity to further enhance the company’s already fertile exploration pipeline.” This announcement summarises assay results received from first pass aircore (AC) drilling over the  Kome auger anomaly and initial reverse circulation (RC) and diamond (DD) drilling at Kouroufing Central. Results are also reported from shallow auger drilling over portions of the Kossaya and Sari Projects located to the immediate north of the Kouroufing Project in Mali. The results form part of the company’s ongoing 2019 drilling campaign, with significant progress already made at the Kouroufing and Dandoko gold Projects. Oklo’s Dandoko, Kouroufing, Kandiole, Kossaya, Moussala and Sari Projects are located in west Mali, 30 km to the east of B2Gold’s 7.1Moz Fekola mine and 50 km to the south-southeast of Barrick’s 12.5 Moz Loulo mine. The company currently holds ~ 500 km2 of highly prospective ground in this world-class gold region in Mali.
