Lonmin CEO, Ben Magara, and AMCU president, Joseph Mathunjwa, reached an agency fee agreement on the eve of Workers’ Day that marked the imminent takeover of Lonmin Platinum by Sibanye-Stillwater. According to Solidarity General Secretary Gideon du Plessis, an amount equal to Amcu’s monthly membership fee would be deducted from all non-Amcu members’ pay as from 1 June 2019 in terms of the agreement. “The timing of this agreement is poor and devious, but it is characteristic of the lack of vision and leadership at Lonmin,” Du Plessis says. Du Plessis also said that while the Labour Relations Act makes provision for such an agreement, this one is a controversial agency agreement which would immediately heighten tensions between Solidarity, NUM and Uasa on the one hand, and Amcu on the other, as those three would now be able to insist on similar agreements at other workplaces at the expense of Amcu members. “Lonmin’s poor judgment also means that Sibanye-Stillwater CEO Neal Froneman’s first task after the takeover would be to accept and implement the Magara and Mathunjwa agreement as provided for in prevailing legislation, and to then prevent a second Marikana at Lonmin mines,” Du Plessis concludes.
