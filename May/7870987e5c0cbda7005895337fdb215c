ASX-listed Pensana Metals’s latest drill results from the infill drilling programme at its Longonjo NdPr rare earths project in Angola has confirmed some of the highest grades returned from the project to date. The results have revealed continuity of the thick blanket of NdPr  rare earths mineralisation which starts at surface. Assay results from the remaining drill holes are expected shortly and will allow an updated Mineral Resource estimate to be completed in support of  the Preliminary Feasibility Study scheduled for completion in September 2019. Pensana Metals' Executive Director Dave Hammond comments: “These high grade NdPr intersections are exceptional and
demonstrate that the weathered blanket of mineralisation at Longonjo contains
some of the best global NdPr grades.” “The close spaced drilling in the proposed open pit area is
confirming the continuity of the NdPr mineralisation over substantial widths
from surface and will provide the detail required to support an upgrade of this
part of the Mineral Resource estimate from the current Inferred to the
Indicated JORC category, as is required for a Preliminary Feasibility Study.”
