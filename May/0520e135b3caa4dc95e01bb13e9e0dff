ASX-listed Pensana Metals continues to advance the development of its World class Angola-based Longonjo neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) project with the appointment of RFC Ambrian as broker for the planned listing on the London Stock Exchange later in the year. This follows the company's appointment of SRK Consulting to provide an updated mineral resource estimate for inclusion in the pre-feasibility study by industry leading engineering firm Wood Group due in September. Anglo American veteran Tim George, who has recently been appointed CEO to lead the development of the Longonjo NdPr project, says that he is delighted with RFC Ambrian’s appointment, who will build on the growing institutional investor interest in the Pensana story ahead of its planned listing on the London Stock Exchange. “We look forward to working with Charlie Cryer and his team at RFC Ambrian bringing institutional investors what is, in our opinion, one of the most exciting pure plays on the EV revolution available anywhere in the world,” says George. According to Charles Cryer, head of RFC Ambrian London says the NdPr space offers a fantastic opportunity for investors to gain direct exposure to the EV revolution. Pensana’s world class resource, excellent logistics and strong business model gives them a terrific platform from which to deliver superior returns.”
