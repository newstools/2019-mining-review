The Eskom board has announced that CEO Phakamani Hadebe will step down at the end of July 2019. A replacement has yet to be confirmed. According to the chairman of the Eskom board, Jabu Mabuza, Phakamani has been instrumental in driving stability at Eskom during a very challenging period at the organisation. “We have learnt to depend on his resilience to drive the kind of transformation that South Africa expects of our organisation. Appreciating the toll that this takes on an individual, we have had to, with regret, accept his decision,” says Mabuza. “It is no secret that this role comes with unimaginable demands which have unfortunatelyhad a negative impact on my health. In the best interests of Eskom and my family, I have therefore decided to step down.” “It has been a privilege to serve South Africans as the Group Chief Executive (GCE) of Eskom,” Hadebe shares. “I am humbled and grateful to have contributed towards the stability
for an organisation that is critical for our economy. I am particularly
grateful to the Board,
the Exco, and all our employees for their resilience and support during this
journey.” The
Eskom board will be engaging over the coming two weeks with the GCE to ensure
continuity and a steady transition. “On behalf of myself and the board, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Hadebe for his contribution to Eskom’s transition journey. The dedication and passion with which he has taken to fulfilling such a critical mandate is commendable,” Mabuza concludes.
