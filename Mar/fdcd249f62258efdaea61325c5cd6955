The in-situ resource carats at Lucapa Diamond Company's Lulo diamond mine in Angola have increased to 80 400 at a modelled average price per carat of US$1 420. Angola – The Lulo
diamond resource was independently estimated and reconciled on a depletion and
addition basis as at 31 December 2018, by external consultants Z Star Mineral
Resource Consultants of Cape Town, South Africa updating the previous Lulo
diamond resource dated 31 May 2017. The updated Lulo diamond resource was estimated after
accounting for: Notwithstanding the depletion of >30 000 carats from
mining, the updated Lulo diamond resource contains a 90% increase of in-situ
carats to 80 400. This total equates to more than four times Lulo’s production
of 19 196 carats in calendar 2018, which was the fourth year of commercial
production at the alluvial mine. In addition, the average US$ per carat value for Lulo
diamonds modelled by Z Star in the updated Lulo diamond resource is $1 420 per
carat, a 17% increase on the previous modelled estimate of $1 215 per carat. Overall sales of Lulo diamonds to date total approximately $141
million at an average price per carat of approximately $2 100. Lucapa Diamond Company MD Stephen Wetherall said the updated
Lulo diamond resource represented the results of another significant
exploration workstream undertaken by the Lulo partners in parallel with the
alluvial mining and kimberlite drilling and sampling programmes. “Together with the significant positive diamond marketing reforms introduced in Angola enabling producers like Lulo to achieve international market prices for their diamonds, the near doubling of insitu resource carats in the upgraded Lulo diamond resource supports the Lulo partners’ (which include Lucapa Diamond Company, Endiama and Rosas & Petalas) a plans to increase alluvial production in 2019,” he says.
