The SAIMM says President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasized the need for all mining stakeholders to come together, to create a common vision of the future, and to work together to achieve it. In doing so, he articulated the following ten principles. Principle 1: We must foster inclusive growth for all stakeholders where mining takes place. This includes employees, their families and surrounding communities. Principle 2: Mining companies should establish partnerships with local governments to address and solve local problems in municipalities and communities. Principle 3: Companies should invest in improving the living conditions of mine workers. Principle 4: Mining companies should invest in education and training, that allows mine employees and communities to transition to a new economy, aligned to industrial revolution 4.0. Principle 5: We should all create partnerships with education and training colleges to ensure curricular are modern and appropriate. Principle 6: We should not be afraid to embrace the principle of increased local beneficiation, to create downstream benefits and employment. Principle 7: We must collectively pat more attention to health and safety in the mining industry. Principle 8: We must constantly look to embrace the aspirations of the youth, by creating internships, job opportunities and local entrepreneurs and SMMEs. Principle 9: We must continue to priorities the representation of women in all levels of management, operations and boards. Principle 10: We must have the courage to include workers and their representatives in our boards. These principles should guide the direction of the SAIMM, to ensure that it contributes as a valued partner in the future of our industry. Let us all consider how we can contribute. Courtesy:
