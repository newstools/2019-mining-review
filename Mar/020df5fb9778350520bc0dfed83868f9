The Fraser Institute’s release of the annual global survey of mining jurisdictions recognises improvements made by South Africa in investment attractiveness and attractiveness of mining policies. In the latest rankings, in terms of the attractiveness of its mining policies, South Africa ranks 56 out of 83 countries surveyed. It improves by 25 spots, compared to being 81 out of 91 in 2017. In terms of investment attractiveness, it bettered its place moving 5 spots from the previous year when it was ranked 48 out of 91 countries; to – now – being 43 out of 83. Welcoming this improvement, the Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, notes that: “The ratings recognise the work done by government in providing stability and certainty on policy and regulation of the mining industry, over the last twelve months.” “This shows that working together with stakeholders in the sector, it is possible to realise South Africa’s potential of being in the top 20 in terms of its attractiveness to the investment community,” says Mantashe. These demonstrative improvements affirm the message of the Government, and the concerted effort, made over the past twelve months. It is essential that all stakeholders in the mining industry and the broader society, come together to realise the call to grow South Africa together. Mining, as an economic activity, is integral to this task to place our country on a higher growth trajectory; to create much-needed employment, reduce poverty, and to increase competitiveness and transformation of the industry.
