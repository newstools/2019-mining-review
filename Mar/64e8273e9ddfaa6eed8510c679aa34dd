Premier African Minerals recently announced that it will recommence drilling at the company's wholly-owned Zulu lithium and tantalum project in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe – Premier African Minerals restated that mobilisation will commence immediately. As such, drilling is expected to commence as soon as mobilisation is complete and seasonal rains permit. The
drilling programme will follow the recommendations identified in the Definitive
Feasibility Study (DFS) work programme. It will focus on expanding both the
size and confidence of the current SAMREC compliant resource at Zulu, as well
as the generation of geotechnical and hydrological data for the pit shell
designs and future mine construction. The company has appointed KME Plant Hire Proprietary Limited (KME) as drilling contractor to carry out these drilling works. As previously announced on 14 February 2019, Premier has announced agreed amended conditional terms to acquire 50% of KME. George Roach, CEO of Premier, stated: "It is gratifying to finally be able to report a return to real value generative operations. With the recently announced term sheet in regard to KME, drilling activities at Zulu are likely to proceed at a much-reduced overall cost. We look forward to further updates on progress at Zulu as we progress into the DFS work programme." The Zulu
lithium and tantalum project is an advanced stage lithium development project.
The project covers c. 3.5km² and is located 80km north east of Bulawayo. In
June 2017, Premier African Minerals announced a Maiden Mineral Inferred
Resource Estimate on Zulu of 20.1 million tonnes grading 1.06% Li2O. In November 2017, the company announced a Scoping Study demonstrating a robust project with a viable process route. Premier African Minerals has lodged an application for an Exclusive Prospecting Order for a 20,200-hectare exploration licence adjacent to the current licences which, once granted, could significantly enhance the project.
