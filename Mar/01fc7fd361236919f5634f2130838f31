Hummingbird Resources has announced its third set of drilling results from the recently completed exploration campaign at its Yanfolila gold mine in Mali. Mali – Hummingbird Resources’ main focus of the exploration campaign was to convert resources to reserves and, in time, extend the mine life. The completed drilling programme largely focused around the resource definition at Gonka, with some further follow up drilling at Komana West. According to
Hummingbird Resources, the latest results demonstrate more high-grade potential
and continued exploration potential at depth. Additionally, in December 2018,
the group announced a set of high-grade results, of which the stand-out intercept
was 15 m @ 16.03 g/t. Hummingbird
Resources  is now focussed on integrating
the positive results seen in its exploration programme into its mine plan. The Gonka
deposit is situated just 5 km from the process plant, making it suitable to be
included in the current mine plan. The deposit is fully permitted and within
the mining license, which will allow mining to start immediately, once the
resource modelling and mine planning is completed. • 18 m @ 9.39 g/t
from 156 m depth (GKRCD0023B) • 4.3 m @ 29.74 g/t
from 250 m depth (GKRCD0050) • 6.5 m @ 6.55 g/t
from 37.8 m depth (GKDD0031) • 3 m @ 12.89 g/t
from 137 m depth (GKRCD0041B) • 10 m @ 3.13 g/t
from 58 m depth (GKRCD0045) • 13.6 m @ 2.56 g/t from 34 m depth (GKDD00011) Murray Paterson, chief geologist for Hummingbird Resources, commented: “Following
the conclusion of the drilling programme at Gonka, we have moved to the
resource modelling phase as we look to publish a new and updated mineral
resource for Gonka and the open pitable reserves. "After this is completed the company plans to release a new life of mine plan at Yanfolila. Our exploration team is reviewing the Gonka drilling data and is planning ahead for the coming 2019 drilling programme, which will target the down dip extensions to Gonka to expand the resource and reserves. "A thorough review of the database to identify new greenfield targets is also underway and this is expected to yield high priority targets to drill test outside the current seven deposits that have resources associated with them,” he concluded.
