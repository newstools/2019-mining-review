Constrained capital expenditure in coal mining is attracting many coal players to the build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) solution for their coal processing plants. There is also growing scope for them to engage a wide range of integrated on-mine services. According to Ken Basson, director: plant and engineering at B&E International, this has much to do with the changing geological and economic landscape in South African coal mining in recent years. As the coal industry has matured, the larger and easier-to-mine deposits have been depleted.
