This session will include prominent business leaders and government officials with insights and extensive knowledge of the sector and the region. Presenters include: Gwede Mantashe, Minister of Mineral Resources of the Republic of South Africa;  Jonathan Veeran, Webber Wentzel Partner; and Deputy Head of Mining and Frank Dixon Mugyenyi, Head of the Mineral Resources Unit at the African Union Commission. Jonathan Veeransays: "We have over the last couple of years seen a resurgence of interest in mining on the continent with growing numbers of delegates attending the Africa focused discussions. "PDAC is a great opportunity to discuss key issues with stakeholders across the globe and to champion mining investment into Africa. We have seen a number of positive steps this year - in South Africa, new leadership has resulted in greater regulatory certainty and a shift to really push for investment in the sector. "We are also seeing countries like Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe creating more enticing environments to promote investment into the sector. "Attending PDAC is an excellent platform to simultaneously engage with African governments and investors in the mining sector. It is a great honour to be part of this event."
