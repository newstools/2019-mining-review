Murray & Roberts has concluded an agreement whereby Cementation Americas has acquired 100% of TNT for a total consideration of US$38 million. Terra Nova Technologies (TNT) provides services to the global mining industry and design, supply and commission overland conveyors, crushing/conveying systems, mobile stacking systems, including dry stack tailings and heap leach systems, crushing and screening plants and in-pit crushing and conveying
systems. TNT also provides process equipment
for mining projects. It has a diverse international
footprint and has delivered 75 projects in more than 15 countries. The acquisition of TNT complements the
engineering and construction services of Cementation Americas (CemA) and the
Murray & Roberts Underground Mining platform. Given the global reach and client
network of the Murray & Roberts Underground Mining platform and the number
of projects in execution at any time, the potential to grow the TNT business is
significant. TNT’s presence in South America is
expected to aid Murray & Roberts’ expansion into this continent. TNT is a successful business which has
reported good financial results since its inception. The high margin/low capital investment
nature of TNT’s business will enhance the Murray & Roberts Underground
Mining platform’s financial results.
