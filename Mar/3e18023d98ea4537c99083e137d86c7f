ASX-listed Triton Minerals has inked an MOU with Chinese graphite company Qingdao Jinhui Graphite Co. in relation to the development of the Ancuabe graphite project in Mozambique. Mozambique – Triton
and Jinhui will now commence technical, legal and commercial due diligence and
continue negotiations with a view to executing a binding agreement within six
months. As envisaged in the MoU, the binding agreement would
include: “This
MOU with Jinhui is a significant endorsement of the Ancuabe project. It is
further evidence that Chinese domestic producers are now actively looking to
East Africa to expand and diversify their high purity and large flake supply
chains in preparation for the significant growth anticipated in the battery and
flame-retardant materials markets. This MOU also is complementary to our
financing discussions in China which are progressing well,” says Triton MD
Peter Canterbury. The Mozambique Ministry of Mines (INAMI) has recommended to
the Minister of Mines that the Ancuabe mining concession be granted for an
initial period of 25 years (renewable for subsequent periods of 25 years). The
mining concession is now with the Minister of Mines for formal signature and
the Mining Cadastre of Mozambique has been updated to a grant date of 27
February 2019 with the nomenclature ‘assignment pending’. Management continue
to do all that is possible to secure the Minister’s signature. They have been assured
that all remains in order.
