B2Gold Corp. has announced positive results from the Expansion Study Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Fekola Mine in Mali. The company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1.5 Mtpa to 7.5 Mtpa from the current base rate of 6 Mtpa. The Expansion Study PEA was conducted to evaluate the life-of-mine (LoM) options for expanded mining and processing to maximize the value of the substantially increased Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource at the Fekola Mine. Results of this study recommend an expansion of the existing plant to process an additional 1.5 Mtpa, resulting in a baseline capacity of 7.5 Mtpa without requiring an additional ball mill or additional power generation capacity. Based on the new optimized mine plan, the mining rate at Fekola will also be increased, along with additional mining equipment to accelerate the supply of higher-grade ore to the expanded processing facilities. As a result of the project and Mineral Resource expansion, the Fekola Mine will produce more gold over a longer life, with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production, revenues and cash flows than the previous LoM.
