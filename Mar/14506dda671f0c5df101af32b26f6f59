Petra Diamonds has recovered a 100.83 carat D-Colour Type II gem quality diamond at its Cullinan mine. This follows another recent recovery of a 6.12 carat Type II blue stone at its Cullinan diamond mine. These recoveries demonstrate the prevalence of these types of stones in the Cullinan ore-body as well as the ability of the mine’s plant to recover the full spectrum of diamonds. Both stones will be included in the company’s upcoming March 2019 tender.
