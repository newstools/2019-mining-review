ASX-listed Kibaran Resources notes that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President John Magufuli of Tanzania have held talks on increasing the economic cooperation between their respective countries. A key outcome of the discussions is a mutual commitment to create a trade and investment climate that’s conducive to fostering a greater bi-lateral relationship to support the potential for Germany to contribute to the industrialisation of the East African country. The talks are additional evidence of positive developments within Tanzania, which include: Kibaran’s Epanko graphite project benefits from strong customer and financier support within Germany for the importation of strategic materials for its key industries and these recent developments provide a positive catalyst for on-going discussions with prospective lenders and the Government of Tanzania to resolve the remaining regulatory issues and secure debt funding to enable construction of the new mine.
