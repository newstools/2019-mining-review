ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho have announced the recovery of an 83.9 carat diamond at Mothae. The diamond was recovered from the new 1.1 Mtpa Mothae kimberlite plant in Lesotho. The 83.9 carat stone is the fourth +50 carat diamond recovered to date from the new Mothae mine, following the recovery of a 51.2 carat diamond in February and Specials weighing 78 carats and 89 carats from the 2018 bulk sampling program. While the 83.9 carat diamond was not gem-quality, it continues to underline the large-stone nature of the Mothae kimberlite resource. Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall says Lucapa and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho continue to be impressed by the Special recoveries from Mothae. “We are highly encouraged that the coarse size fraction in our recently commenced commercial production through the new 1.1 Mtpa Mothae plant is reinforcing why Lucapa invested in this second high-value resource to complement production from the Lulo mine in Angola,” says Wetherall. Lucapa is a growing diamond company with high-value mines in Angola and Lesotho, along with exploration projects in Angola, Australia and Botswana. Lucapa’s vision is to become a leading producer of large and premium-quality diamonds - from both alluvial and kimberlite sources - in Africa and other known diamond provinces around the world. The company’s focus on high-value diamond production is designed to protect cash flows in a sector of the diamond market where demand and prices remains robust.
