Mining Indaba is already a month behind us; can you believe it? Having immersed myself in all that the conference and exhibition had to offer over four days, I have come away feeling uplifted. Delegate numbers were undeniably up and I felt a buzz in the air that I havenâ€™t felt in years. This was likely the result of a lot of intensive effort by the Mining Indaba team to provide relevant and interesting information to its audience, in combination with a general consensus that the industry as a whole is definitely no longer in the doldrums of a long-lasting recession.
