SEMAFO and Savary Gold have entered an agreement pursuant to which SEMAFO will acquire all shares of Savary not already owned by it. The transaction is being carried out by way of a three-cornered amalgamation. Savary shareholders will vote on the Amalgamation at a special meeting of Savary shareholders with closing expected to take place by the end of April 2019. Benoit Desormeaux, President and CEO of SEMAFO, states, "Our acquisition of the Karankasso property reflects our core strategy of creating long-term value through developing and operating high quality assets. "The acquisition provides a consolidated district-scale land package in a country we know well and on the prolific Houndé Greenstone Belt, which we also know very well. "We see excellent potential for resource growth on the combined 1,250 km², and when this transaction is consummated we anticipate the combined property will head up our development pipeline." Don Dudek, President and CEO of Savary, says, "Over the past few years, Savary has delivered on its commitment to create value for its shareholders through its disciplined approach to exploration and resource development. "The transaction with SEMAFO is consistent with that commitment as our shareholders will benefit from having ownership in an intermediate, multi-mine producer with a portfolio of high-quality assets and a proven and experienced management team that shares our commitment to creating long-term sustainable value. "On closing, our shareholders can maintain exposure to the district-scale land package as it becomes one of SEMAFO's top development pipeline projects."
