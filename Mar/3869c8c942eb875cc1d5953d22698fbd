South Africa’s largest coal producer and black-empowered coal company Exxaro has unveiled its new headquarters, the conneXXion. Exxaro CEO Mxolisi Mgojo says the new building is the physical
manifestation of the group’s drive toward innovation and of using technology to
improve operations and its environmental footprint. Says Mgojo, “The conneXXion epitomises innovation, which is the byword
at Exxaro these days. In addition, the conneXXion displays our commitment to
the environment; to reducing our carbon footprint, conserving natural
resources, and creating a sustainable company for our employees and South
Africa. “This is just another step in Exxaro’s drive to improve our
environmental footprint while also ensuring that we remain an employer of
choice. Exxaro is deeply committed to making life better not just for our
employees, but also for the communities in which we operate.” In addition to e-parking bays that will allow employees to charge their
electric or hybrid vehicles while they work, the conneXXion also boasts
“visually-attractive central staircases” aimed at encouraging employees to
avoid using the lifts. The conneXXion also aims at creating a harmonious work environment for its approximately 650 employees, with specially-designed “hives” where groups can collaborate or engage in individual work. Exxaro will move into the 18 000 m2 building, which is situated in West Street opposite the Centurion Gautrain station, in June. The conneXXion’s
environmental features include: Overall, the conneXXion
is expected to consume 76% less water than national best practice and will
prevent the waste of two of the country’s most finite resources: energy and
water.
