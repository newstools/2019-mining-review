Mako Gold has intersected wide mineralized zones along significant strike lengths up to 2 km parallel to the trend of the regional shear zone. The company is pleased to report assay results received from its 17-hole reverse circulation (RC) drilling program totalling 2,550 m at the Napié Project in Côte d’Ivoire. Mako is earning up to a 75% interest in the Napie Project under a farm-in and joint venture agreement with Occidental Gold SARL, a subsidiary of West African gold miner Perseus Mining Limited (ASX/TSX:PRU1). Mako’s MD, Peter Ledwidge comments: “We are pleased with results of our recent drilling program on Napié. The gold results returned from drilling confirm that there are multiple, wide, parallel gold mineralised zones. "We have now intersected these wide mineralized zones along significant strike lengths up to 2 km parallel to the trend of the regional shear zone. "This increases our confidence in the potential for the Napié Project to host an economic gold deposit along the 23 km-long gold geo-chemical anomaly.” Mako Gold has entered into a farm-in and joint venture agreement with Occidental Gold SARL, a subsidiary of West African gold miner Perseus Mining to earn up to 75% of the Napié Permit conditional on certain milestones being achieved.
