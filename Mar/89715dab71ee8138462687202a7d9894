Mozal Aluminium has donated US$250,000 to support recovery efforts following the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. Mozal Aluminium vice president of operations, Samuel Samo
Gudo, said the company was committed to making a difference for the communities
impacted by the tragic event, especially those in the city of Beira which is
partially isolated from the other parts of the country. “Our thoughts and
prayers go out to everyone who has been affected by Cyclone Idai in the central
region,” Gudo said. The donation will be made to a humanitarian institution that will provide immediate help with minimising food and water shortages and restoring infrastructure in the affected areas. In addition to the US$250,000 contribution, Mozal Aluminium is coordinating monetary and nonperishable food donations from its employees. South32 will also match any financial contributions from employees around the world made via its employee matched giving programme. Mozal Aluminium is a South32-operated aluminium smelter
located near the Mozambican capital of Maputo, which has not been impacted by
the cyclone. The smelter has been in operation for more than 20 years and
employs around 1,150 people. Meanwhile, the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), announced nearly $3.4 million in additional emergency
humanitarian food assistance to meet the urgent needs caused by Cyclone Idai. The funding, provided to the World Food Programme, will help
deliver approximately 2,500 metric tons of rice, peas, and vegetable oil to
affected people in Sofala, Zambezia, and Manica Provinces.  This
life-saving emergency food assistance will support approximately 160,000 people
for one month.
