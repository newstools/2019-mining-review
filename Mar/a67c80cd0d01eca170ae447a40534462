Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has requested the assistance of the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, to intervene in the current instability in Carletonville (South Africa). He hopes this will restore and safeguard the safety and security of the community. The strike underway at Sibanye-Stillwater, which began in November 2018, has become violent, impacting negatively on communities in the area, with nine deaths reported thus far and an estimated 62 houses burnt down.
