Barrick Gold Corporation is reviewing a range of new
exploration opportunities and re-evaluating its existing operations and
projects in Chile, says the company’s new president and CEO Mark Bristow. Speaking after a meeting with Minister of Mining Baldo
Prokurica, Bristow said Barrick’s Chilean assets were an important part of its
global portfolio and noted that the company has recently approved an investment
to increase productivity at its jointly owned Zaldívar copper mine. Over the past 10 years, Barrick has spent some $8 billion in Chile on exploration, development, royalties and taxes, wages, and payments to local suppliers. In the country to review the company’s LATAM strategy with its executive team, he said the studies on the Norte Abierto copper and gold joint venture project were advancing, while the Alturas project was making good progress. Alturas is located in a very prospective region, and Barrick is currently exploring for further discoveries there. As far as Pascua-Lama was concerned, he said the focus was on resolving legal, environmental and other issues along with a technical review of the project parameters and future potential. As part of this work, Barrick has conducted extensive geo-hydrological and geochemical studies for a water management plan through which the natural water flow path can be restored. “Chile is an investor-friendly country, with a significant
mineral endowment, and which encourages the development of mining projects. We
believe there are exciting opportunities here, especially in the El Indio
region, and we shall be pursuing this in line with our strategy of creating
value for all our stakeholders, including the governments, and people, of our
host countries,” Bristow said.
