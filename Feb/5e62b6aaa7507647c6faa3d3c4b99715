The Minerals Council South Africa Emerging Miners’ Desk congratulates Orion Minerals for achieving second place in the Mining Indaba Investment Battlefield Competition. Orion Minerals presented its Prieska Zinc Copper Project, located in the Northern Cape in South Africa. Errol Smart, CEO of Orion Minerals, is also the Chairman of the Minerals Council Junior and Emerging Miners’ Leadership Forum, and represents this important constituency on the Minerals Council Board. Grant Mitchell who heads up the Emerging Miners’ Desk at the Minerals Council says: “We are simply delighted by this tremendous achievement. We wish Orion Minerals all success going forward.” The Junior and Emerging Miners’ Desk today hosted a media briefing outlining the important contribution made by junior and emerging miners. In 2018, the junior and emerging miners generated R54.4 billion in revenue and spent R55.5 billion, despite the challenging times faced by the industry as a whole. Developing this important component of the mining industry is key to growing and sustaining the mining industry in future.
