Today, the 5th of February 2019, the South African Department of Mineral Resources commemorates the incident which took place at Lily Mine in Mpumalanga. Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi were trapped underground when the lamp-room in which they were working in collapsed and remains underground. The Department supports all efforts to ensure the new owners are able to
resume operations and find the container, so their families and loved ones can
have closure.
