Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe has called on the mining industry to prioritise improving relations with communities and employees in areas where they operate. This follows the Minister’s inspection at Mineral Sands Resources’ Tormin mine outside Vredendal in the Western Cape. The Minister visited the mine to check its level of
compliance with environmental, social and labour plans, transformation as well
as health and safety imperatives, as stipulated in the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Act and the Mining Charter. “Sustainable development is critical. Mining must be done in such a way as to ensure that future generations are not worse off,” said Mantashe. “Mining companies must leave a positive legacy in areas where they operate, and positively coexist with the community, environment, and other economic sectors,” Mantashe said. “The mining industry must appreciate that the world is
changing around them. They must respect workers and communities, and they must
ensure that they comply with the mining and environmental laws of the country.”
