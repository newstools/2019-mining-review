Firestone Diamonds has announced the recovery of a 70 carat white, makeable diamond from its Liqhobong Mine in Lesotho. This follows after a 46 carat gem diamond that was recovered in December, sold for more than US$1 million at a recently held sale. The 70 carat diamond was recovered undamaged and will go on sale at the next tender which is scheduled to take place during March 2019. Paul Bosma, CEO, comments: "The 70 carat stone was recovered in the northern, low grade part of the pit in Lesotho where the bulk of our mining will take place in the coming months. "Although the market for the smaller stones has been under pressure, weâ€™ve seen continued demand and good prices realised for special stones".
