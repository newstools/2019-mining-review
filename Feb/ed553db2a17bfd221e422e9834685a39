SEMAFO has announced an updated inferred resource estimation for its Nabanga deposit. Burkino Faso – The Nabanga deposit is located on the Yactibo Project, 125 km south-west of the Boungou Mine and 250 km south-east of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Highlight’s of SEMAFO’s estimation are: The estimation update is based on 395 drill holes (RC and DD combined)
totalling 57,488 metres including 67 core holes drilled since the latest
estimation completed by Snowden in August 2012, plus a revised interpretation
of the mineralisation that suggests a shallower plunge of the higher-grade
zones of gold mineralisation. The 2018 exploration program (24 holes) was
designed to explore the shallow plunge interpretation. Nabanga is a typical ''intrusion-related'' type deposit, predominately
hosted within a magnetite-rich granodiorite intrusive. Gold mineralisation is
associated with quartz veining and a distinctive alteration zone developed
around the structure. The updated resource estimation, coupled with recent exploration work,
continue to underline the quality of the Nabanga deposit as a high-grade gold
mineralisation zone that remains open to the north-east. In addition, recent
auger drilling surrounding the deposit identified gold geochemical anomalies
that could offer proximal satellite zones of gold mineralisation. The 2019 exploration program at Nabanga has been designed to test the
northern extension. It is to further explore the down-plunge extensions confirmed
by recent drilling, and test drill auger geochemical anomalies proximal to the
deposit for satellite mineralisation. While SEMAFO continues to work on
expanding the resource, it will complete a PEA study using the current
estimation to assess economic viability of the project. The resource estimate assumes a long-term gold price of US$1,500 per ounce
and a recovery of 81% based on the historic metallurgical test work previously completed
by Snowden in 2012.
