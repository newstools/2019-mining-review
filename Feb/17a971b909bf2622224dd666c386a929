The Minerals Council South Africa has published the Facts and Figures 2018 pocketbook, which provides preliminary insights into the latest available trends across South Africa’s mining industry. The contents of the pocketbook was discussed during The State of the Mining Nation media briefing at at Mining Indaba 2019. In 2018, the mining industry: During 2018 the mining industry’s growth rate was greater than that of the national economy, albeit that the national growth rate of 1.2% was disappointing. It is pleasing that employment in some sectors grew during the period (coal, iron ore, manganese and chrome). However, this growth is masked by reductions in employment in gold and platinum, resulting in a net job loss in the sector. The industry experienced an input cost inflation of
approximately 6%. Industrial chemicals and petroleum were key drivers of the
inflation profile. On aggregate, rand commodity prices increased by 1.7%,
representing a substantial negative differential between input cost inflation
and selling price inflation. Due to the combination of rand commodity prices stagnating
since their peak at the beginning of 2017, and costs rising faster than the
prices received, the mining industry has been in a ‘profit squeeze’ for at
least the last five years. This has had a direct negative impact on dividend payments
to investors. Mining plays a significant role in the economy of South
Africa. The Minerals Council is of the view that it is critically
important for data related to our industry to be freely available and easily
accessible for stakeholders to be well informed about the state of the mining
industry and the contribution it makes. The pocketbook, prepared by the Minerals Council’s economics
department, provides preliminary insights into the latest available trends in
South Africa’s mining industry and is a precursor to the more comprehensive
Facts and Figures booklet which is published later in the year.
