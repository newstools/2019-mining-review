Aquila Steel, a subsidiary of China’s Baowu Group, has announced that the Constitutional Court has upheld a High Court judgment granting the company a mining right over its Gravenhage manganese deposit, located in the Northern Cape. Aquila has been hampered for
several years in its planned development of Gravenhage by an overlapping claim
by Pan African Mineral Development Company (PAMDC). In a resounding endorsement of
Aquila’s rights in November 2016, the High Court had set aside PAMDC’s claim,
upheld Aquila’s prospecting right and granted Aquila’s mining right application
over Gravenhage. However, in late 2017, PAMDC successfully appealed the High
Court’s findings at the Supreme Court of Appeal. On 15 February 2019, the Constitutional Court set aside the SCA judgment and upheld the High Court judgment. As a consequence, Aquila has been granted the mining right, subject only to administrative steps to be implemented within three months by the Minister of Mineral Resources.
