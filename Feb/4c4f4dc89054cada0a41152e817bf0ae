Sibanye-Stillwater advises that the Labour Court has rejected Sibanye Stillwater's application on technical legal grounds. Due to AMCU causing ongoing delays to the verification process ordered by the Court on 21 December 2018*, the company had applied to the Court for the cessation of the strike, pending the outcome of the verification process. The Court however found that the previous decision of the Court was final in its effect. "We respect the Court's ruling, but are disappointed that the merits of our case were not heard, and the ruling was made on a legal technicality," states Sibanye-Stillwater, CEO Neal Froneman. "We remain extremely concerned about the impact the protracted strike is having on the financial wellbeing of our employees, which is being exacerbated by ongoing delays to the verification process due to AMCU's continual legal challenges. "We will continue to pursue various avenues, without compromising other stakeholders, to bring an end to this strike as soon as possible," concludes Neal Froneman.
