Lonmin has received written notice of a secondary strike
action from AMCU to take place at its operations. The strike action is in support of the protected strike
action at Sibanye Stillwater gold operations. According to the correspondence received, the strike will
commence on Thursday, 28 February 2019 until 7 March 2019. Lonmin is in the process of obtaining legal advice to inform
our response to the notice. AMCU has been striking at Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations since late last year in protest of the merger with Lonmin. The labour court most recently rejected the company’s application to suspend the strike – because of a ‘legal technicality’.
