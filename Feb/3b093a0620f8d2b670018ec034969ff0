Rishon Chimboza, Mining Sector Lead at africapractice, speaks to us about what should be taking place in Zimbabwe to revive the country's natural resources sector. Mining is a crucial industry in Zimbabwe but has potential to be so much bigger than it currently is. There are just a handful of significant mining companies in the country which includes Zimplats, Caledonia Mining, Anglo American Platinum and Metallon. According government all minerals-extraction operations excluding platinum and diamonds can be 100% foreign owned. The platinum and diamond sectors must have 51% local ownership, but this can also be altered on a case by case scenario.
