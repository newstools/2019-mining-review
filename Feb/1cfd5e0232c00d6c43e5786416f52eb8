“Hope is in the air. We can see the green shoots of optimism coming through.” This is the view of Roger Baxter, CEO of Minerals Council of South Africa (MCSA). Baxter was addressing the media on the state of the mining nation on the first day at Mining Indaba 2019. Baxter explained that since the appointment of Cyril
Ramaphosa as President coupled with Gwede Mantashe taking up the post of
Mineral Resources minister, there has been intensive engagement between
government and key stakeholders to get the industry back on track. Baxter added
that at 1.2%, mining industry growth in 2018 was more than that of the national
economy. “The sector is estimated to have contributed R356 billion to
GDP in 2018,” Baxter added. “In addition, mining exported 66% of its production
to international buyers or commodity markets. At around $50 billion, these
dollar earnings are equal to half of South Africa’s foreign reserves.” Positively, employment grew in some sectors such as coal,
iron, ore and manganese. However, weaknesses in gold and platinum resulted in a
net job loss in the sector. At the same time, Baxter cautioned against implementing
Eskom’s proposed 15% tariff hike over the next three years. “If this happens,
there will be no deep level mining and smelting and refining will take a huge knock,”
he warned. He further urged government to look into restructuring the power
utility, including rethinking its current workforce. Baxter stated that he is pleased with the transformation that
has taken place since the Chamber of Mines changed its name to MCSA. “We
currently have more than 300 emerging and junior miners who are members of the
Association.” Addressing safety and health concerns, Baxter explained that
this issue will remain MCSA’s number priority until the Zero Harm target is
realised.
