WINNER: GoldPlat Goldplat has carefully designed a highly skilled processing route that provides an environmental and economic solution for mines to dispose of waste materials. It does so by recovering precious metals, primarily gold and silver but also platinum group metals (PGMs), from by-products of the mining industry and related industries. These materials, that
include fine carbon, mill liners and waste grease, typically present an
environmental risk and cost to producers but can become a source of precious
metals and revenue when processed by Goldplat. The company delivers
this innovative service through two established gold recovery operations in
South Africa and Ghana and has built a substantial blue-chip supplier base. This includes most of
the significant gold producers, an increasing number of PGM producers, and
several refineries requiring the processing of concentrate materials prior to
final refining as bullion. Processes employed for
precious metal recovery include roasting in a rotary kiln, crushing, milling, thickening,
flotation, gravity concentrators, leaching, CIL, elution and smelting of
bullion. Because of the diversity
and flexibility of these treatment circuits, which make possible the recovery
of metals and concentrates from a range of by-product materials, and the
extensive depth of knowledge and experience of its longstanding team, Goldplat
has become a market leader in gold recovery with a significant competitive
advantage. Marcus Courage: “Uses ‘waste' to produce precious stones” Jim Pooley: “Innovative and flexible processing route for various types of feed with a positive knock on effect on waste and environment”
