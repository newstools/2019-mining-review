Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe says the priority remains to restore ventilation to Gloria mine and reduce flammable gases underground so the search and recovery process can continue with the necessary speed. Furthermore, the Minister has called for security at mines to be enhanced in order to effectively address illegal mining. Seven bodies were discovered in the early hours of Thursday morning, and
work to retrieve them will continue once power and ventilation are restored and
the flammable gases underground are brought down to more manageable levels. Cable and copper theft resulted in power to the mine being stopped,
increasing the level of poisonous gases underground. “The work to retrieve the bodies found at Gloria mine is quite complex but it must be allowed to continue so that there can be closure on this matter. "The business rescue for Optimum, Koornfontein and the other operations must also continue at a faster pace than is currently unfolding, so the mine can get back to operation and get the local economy going again,” the Minister said. The proto teams continue to assess the gas levels underground, and work
is expected to continue tomorrow morning. I am guessing the reason I have not read much about Gloria coal mine before today is because the people trapped underground are not ZA nationals, and because they were in a non-operational mine. https://t.co/c8tM2e0hyZ Gloria coal mine gas explosion death toll rises to 13 https://t.co/VTBhLwntIX Police on Wednesday said they had to turn away the families of people trapped in the Gupta-owned Gloria mine, which was rocked by an underground gas explosion. https://t.co/lggq9NvhCo
