Whether pumped hydroelectric, run-of-river, or small hydro power systems there is a growing need to use Africa’s vast hydro potential to boost reliability of power in remote areas, and specifically for the mining industry. The potential is there, however, it’s not without its financial, operational and environmental challenges. This webinar, moderated by ESI Africa editor Nicolette Pombo-van Zyl and Mining Review Africa editor Laura Cornish will address the commercial and operational value of hydropower at Africa’s mines. Key points of discussion: 1. How can hydropower development benefit new and existing mining projects in remote parts of Africa? 2. Weighing in on the financial benefits – capex vs. opex vs. traditional diesel power supply. 3. How to incorporate hydropower into organisational corporate social responsibility for communities 4. A view on environmental impact assessment best practices for hydropower projects 5. How can hydropower projects mitigate the effects of climate change to remain a relevant source of power for mining operations? Join our guest speakers as they unpack these key points on the ground rules around hydropower in the mining industry. Speakers: TBC Sponsored by:
