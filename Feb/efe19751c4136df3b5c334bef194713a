The Mining Review Africa team is onsite at the Investing in African Mining Indaba 2019 to report on the day's highlights. The opening keynote address will be delivered by South African  President Cyril Ramaphosa.  With a focus on growth, youth employment, land reform and tackling social inequality, Ramaphosa announced last year a drive to secure $100 billion of foreign investment for South Africa and has conducted several successful trade missions - the mining sector is a key role to play in this.
