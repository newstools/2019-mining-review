JSE/NYSE-listed Sibanye-Stillwater reports that the independent exercise to verify the movement in union membership of employees at the South African Gold operations between 22 November 2018 was concluded on 4 April 2019. The outcome of the Verification Exercise supports Management’s position that on 18 February 2019, the NUM, UASA and Solidarity collectively represented the majority of employees at the South African gold operations. Sibanye-Stillwater intends to approach the Labour Court to declare the current AMCU strike unprotected. Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye-Stillwater commenting on the outcome says: "The independent verification exercise, will now form the basis to implement the extension of the wage agreement in terms of Section 23(1)(d) of the Labour Relations Act, No 66 of 1995 (“S23(1)(d)”). "Our attempts to lawfully end this strike have been frustrated by ongoing legal challenges by AMCU since mid-December 2018, which has unnecessarily extended the strike, to the significant detriment of its members. "AMCU has again challenged the outcome of the Verification Exercise and we again urge AMCU leadership to allow due processes to be followed in the interest of a peaceful resolution to this strike. "Irrespective of the court outcome we will not entertain a revision to the wage agreement or any other type of settlement that undermines our other stakeholders.”
