Lucara Diamond Corp. has recovered a 1 758 carat diamond from its 100% owned Karowe mine located in Botswana. The diamond is one of the largest diamonds in recorded history. It is also the largest diamond recovered in Botswana and the largest diamond to be mined at Karowe to date. The unbroken 1 758 carat stone was recovered through Lucara's state of the art XRT circuit, commissioned in April 2015. Weighing close to 352 g and measuring 83 mm x 62 mm x 46 mm, the diamond has been characterised as near gem of variable quality, including domains of high-quality white gem. Further detailed analysis is ongoing. Since commissioning of the XRT circuit in 2015, a total of 12 diamonds in excess of 300 carats have been recovered at Karowe, including two greater than 1 000 carats, from a total production of approximately 1.4 million carats. Of the 12 +300 carat diamonds recovered, 50% were categorised as gem quality with 11 sold to date generating revenue in excess of US$158 million. Eira Thomas, Lucara's CEO comments: "Lucara's technologically advanced, XRT diamond recovery circuit has once again delivered historic results. Karowe has now produced two diamonds greater than 1 000 carats in just four years." "This affirms the coarse nature of the resource and the likelihood of recovering additional, large, high quality diamonds in the future, particularly as we mine deeper in the ore body and gain access to the geologically favourable EM/PK(S) unit, the source of both of our record breaking, +1 000 carat diamonds."
