Petra Diamonds has confirmed it has recovered a 209.9 carat D colour Type II gem quality diamond at its Cullinan Diamond Mine. This is the third +100ct
Type II D colour gem quality diamond recovered since March 2019, and the fourth
such stone in the current financial year. This recovery demonstrates the prevalence of these types of stones in the Cullinan ore-body, with an improved incidence of large and high-value stones as the C-Cut Phase 1 block cave progresses across the footprint, and the ability of the mine’s plant to recover the full spectrum of diamonds. The stone is expected to be sold during the fourth quarter ending 30 June 2019. Petra has also confirmed that ‘The Legacy’, the exceptional 425 carat D colour Type II A diamond recovered from the Cullinan mine on 29 March 2019, together with this stone, will be offered for sale during the course of the company’s next sales cycle in South Africa.
