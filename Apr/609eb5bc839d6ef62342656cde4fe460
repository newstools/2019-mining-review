Firestone Diamonds has announced the recovery of a 72 carat yellow, makeable diamond from its Liqhobong Mine in Lesotho, during the past weekend. The 72 carat diamond was recovered together with a 22 carat makeable white stone, followed by an 11 carat fancy light-pink stone. These diamonds will go on sale at the next tender which is scheduled to take place during May 2019. This is the second c.70 carat stone recovered from the operation this calendar year, following the 70 carat white. Paul Bosma, CEO, comments: "It was a good weekend for us, recovering the 72 carat diamond as well as the two smaller, high quality stones from within the northern, lower grade part of the pit. "These recoveries will certainly assist in supporting the average value of the next sale in May." In February the company announced the recovery of a 70 carat white, makeable diamond Liqhobong. This followed a 46 carat gem diamond recovered in December 2018, that sold for more than US$1 million.
