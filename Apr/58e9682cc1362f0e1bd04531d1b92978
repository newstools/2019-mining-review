Ivanhoe Mines has expressed strong support for the DRC’s aim to attract foreign investment and to accelerate the development of its mineral potential for the benefit of all stakeholders. This comes in the wake of a meeting between Robert
Friedland and Yufeng “Miles” Sun, co-chairmen of Ivanhoe Mines and newly
elected DRC president Félix Tshisekedi, who was on an official visit to the
United States. Discussions were focused on updating the president on the rapid progress being made in the development of the Kamoa-Kakula Project, a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines, Zijin Mining Group and the DRC government, and the Kipushi Project, a joint venture between Ivanhoe and La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines), the DRC state-owned mining company. Long-term commitment In addition, Ivanhoe Mines updated the president on the company’s exploration programmes in the Lualaba Province that may be expanded to include prospective areas of the country’s Kasai Province. “We share president Tshisekedi’s determination to develop a strong partnership between international mining companies and the Democratic Republic of Congo,” said Friedland. “This is a time of historic opportunity for responsible development of the mining sector in the DRC. We look forward to working with all members of the newly-elected government to introduce it to investors around the globe. “With the continued support of the government, Kamoa-Kakula is on track to become one of the world’s greatest copper mining complexes, helping to cement the DRC as a global, top tier copper producer. The Kipushi Project will benefit from similar support and propel the DRC to become a significant zinc producer as well,” Friedland concluded.
