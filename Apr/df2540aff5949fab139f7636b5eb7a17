Just five weeks after Cyclone Idai battered Mozambique claiming the lives of atleast 1 000 people in East Africa, Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique on 25 April, carving yet another path of destruction in its wake. Fortunately, one of
the most prominent mining players in the country, ASX-listed Syrah Resources’
Balama graphite operation, has made it out unscathed for a second time and has
been impacted by the cyclone, enabling the company to continue production ramp
up with sales and shipping of graphite progressing as planned. Whilst rain and wind
were recorded at Balama, preparatory action on site was established to ensure
the safety of Syrah’s people and security of operating equipment. Cyclone Kenneth is the
second significant weather event in a matter of weeks to strike Mozambique. The
full impact of Cyclone Kenneth on people and infrastructure, the second
significant weather event in Mozambique in a matter of weeks, is yet to be
established,” says Syrah Resources CEO Shaun Verner. “Syrah and its
employees have been active both directly and through Red Cross Mozambique in
assisting in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai around Beira, and we will of course
be assessing how we can assist in Cabo Delgado, should this be necessary,” he
concluded.
