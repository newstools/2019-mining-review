Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has urged South African ccoal miners to continue investing in clean-coal technology. Coal continues to form
a key part of South Africa’s energy mix, in line with the country’s Integrated
Resource Plan. The Minister was
speaking at the official opening of one of the largest underground coal
complexes in the world, Sasol’s Impumelelo Colliery in Mpumalanga. This is the fifth mine
to be opened in the past 12 months, an indication of South Africa’s
attractiveness as an investment destination of choice, and the conducive policy
and regulatory environment for the sector to do business. “We welcome this
investment by Sasol. In an economy where unemployment is so high, these new
mines are making a positive impact on job creation,” says Mantashe. “We have an economy to
grow, and therefore as Government we will continue to prioritise the creation
of a stable environment for this economic growth to happen.” Mantashe further urged
mining companies to prioritise coexistence with communities and development
around mining towns, for the long-term sustainability of mining.
