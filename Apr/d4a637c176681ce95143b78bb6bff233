The Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, will officially hand over a 50% shareholding held by mining company Exxaro in Arnot coal mine to former Arnot Coal employees. The
handover is an industry milestone towards the inclusion of workers as
meaningful stakeholders, as enshrined in the Mining Charter which came into
effect in 2018. A Section 11 approval in terms of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) was granted by the Department last week and will see 50% of Arnot coal mine owned by the former Exxaro employees, and 50% by Wescoal.
