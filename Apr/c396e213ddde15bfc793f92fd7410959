The team continues to streamline and optimise each part of the system and the transhipment process is also performing well with loading rates and barge cycle times running efficiently. Management is now looking to the next phase of the project and have conducted preliminary engineering studies to evaluate the expansion to a 10 Mtpa operation. Initial economics from these studies are robust and indicate this would be a capital efficient way to optimise project capabilities.
