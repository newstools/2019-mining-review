Lesotho. The 55 carat stone is the fifth +50 carat diamond recovered
to date from the new Mothae mine, where commercial production commenced in
January 2019 following the successful commissioning and ramp-up phases for the
new plant and an earlier bulk sampling campaign. In March Lucapa announced its previous +50 carat stone recovery from Mothae of an 83.9 carat diamond. Click here to read more about this find.
