Mabiza Resources and its major investor CNM have announced the resumption of mining operations at the Munali nickel mine in Southern Zambia. “It is with great pride that we celebrate the official opening of Munali mine. Today marks a new beginning for the mine with a bright future ahead, backed by an experienced investor Consolidated Nickel Mines," says  Matthew Banda, General Manager of the Munali nickel mine and Mabiza Resources. “We are committed to being a responsible miner and ensuring the socio-economic benefits created by the mine are lasting and shared with our local communities and host government.” “This is the culmination of nearly four years of hard work by the team and has involved a full reassessment of the project to de-risk it both technically and economically," says Simon Purkiss, CEO of CNM. I’d like to thank all the stakeholders involved – our employees and contractors, local communities, business partners, regulatory authorities and Government – who have contributed to our plan to re-start operations at the Munali Nickel Mine. This is a tremendous accomplishment.” Since CNM became the new operators of the Munali Nickel Mine in 2014, the experienced team has invested over $50 million to restart the mine. Consolidated Nickel Mines (CNM) has undertaken a complete reassessment of the project. All key technical aspects have been reviewed and re-engineered, from re-interpreting the orebody, changing the mining method, to revising the metallurgical process with the introduction of Dense Media Separation (DMS) technology and differential flotation. The mine comprises an underground mining operation extracting nickel sulphide ore, DMS technology and standard flotation circuit to produce a 10-12% concentrate. The mine expects to ramp-up production to steady-state levels of 60,000 tpa by Q4, 2019. The mine is managed by an all-Zambian management team and currently has a workforce of 380 people, of which 10% are women.
