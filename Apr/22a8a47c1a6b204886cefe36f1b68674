IronRidge Resources has announced the Zaranou Gold Project Licence has been granted, and it has extended the exclusive due diligence period to the highly prospective gold license in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa. Commenting on the company’s latest progress, Vincent Mascolo, CEO and MD of IronRidge, says: “We are very pleased that the Zaranou Gold Project exploration licence has been granted ahead of schedule. “The extension of due diligence allows the vendor additional time to complete in country administrative processes, which have taken longer than anticipated. “We are working closely with the vendors in preparation for the commencement of exploration programmes in the coming months.” Highlights: The Zaranou license is located approximately 200 km north-east of the capital Abidjan, adjacent to the border with Ghana. Access is via a good, sealed bitumen road via Adzopé in the south and Abengourou in the north with a laterite road running 60 km sub-parallel along the entire extent of the mapped target shear zone and artisanal mining zones.
