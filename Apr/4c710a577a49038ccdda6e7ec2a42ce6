Rio Tinto has approved the next stage in the development
of Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa through the construction of the Zulti
South project. The US$463 million (Rio Tinto share $343 million) investment
will sustain Richards Bay Minerals (RBM’s) current capacity and extend mine
life. RBM currently operates four mines in the Zulti North lease
area, a mineral separation plant and smelting facility. The Zulti North ore body
grade is declining, hence the Zulti South mine is required to maintain the
output of high-margin zircon and rutile, and provide sufficient ore to support
TiO2 sales. The Zulti South mine (Phase 1) will underpin RBM’s supply of
zircon and ilmenite over the life of mine. Construction is scheduled to start
in mid-2019, subject to the granting of all necessary permits, with first
commercial production expected in late 2021. The investment will be fully self-funded from RBM’s cash
flows, with no additional debt or recourse to Rio Tinto. The project is expected
to deliver an internal rate of return of 24% (Rio Tinto share). Rio Tinto chief executive J-S Jacques says: “Rio Tinto has a long history in South Africa, and today’s
investment underscores our commitment for the coming decades and beyond.”



“Zulti South is one of the best undeveloped minerals sand deposits in
the industry, and will significantly extend RBM’s position as a world-class,
first-quartile asset. The long-term fundamentals of the market remain strong,
and production from Zulti South will commence in time to fill a widening supply
gap, ensuring RBM’s position as a leader in the sector, and delivering strong
returns to our shareholders.”
