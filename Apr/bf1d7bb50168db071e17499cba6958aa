ASX and JSE-listed Orion Minerals has confirmed its intention to undertake an A$8 million capital raising priced at $0.04 per fully paid ordinary share – which is a 30% premium to its last ASX traded price. Orion last week suspended share trading on the JSE and ASX
pending release of an announcement in relation to a capital raising and
finalisation of agreements related to restructuring of the company’s
broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) partnerships. In relation to this transaction, the company noted that its South
African investors will subscribe for about half the shares on offer in the
placement as part of the company’s BEE obligations with Orion’s biggest
shareholder, London-based Tembo Capital, taking another significant chunk of
shares. The $8 million capital raising will be undertaken at an
issue price of $0.04 per share, together with one free attaching option for
every two shares issued (exercise price of $0.05 and a term of approximately
six months), to be conducted via a placement to sophisticated and professional
investors. The capital raising is likely to be underpinned by a group
of high-profile black South African investors as part of a broader
restructuring of the company’s black-empowerment equity at operating level,
achieving compliance with the South African Mining Charter 3. The interrelated transactions will represent a pivotal milestone for Orion ahead of the expected imminent grant of the mining right for its flagship Prieska zinc-copper project, in South Africa’s Northern Cape province and the delivery of the bankable feasibility study later this quarter. In addition to strengthening its balance sheet as it moves
towards project financing, the transactions will result in the introduction of
a high-profile South African investor group to its share register, ensure an
appropriate alignment and restructuring of its BEE interests across both
project and listed company levels, and significantly elevate its profile
amongst South African institutional investors as it prepares to develop the
Prieska project.
