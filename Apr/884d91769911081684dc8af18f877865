This week's MRA Insight edition examines coal. As Eskom struggles to keep the lights on in the country energy experts are calling for less reliance on coal and more investment in renewables. We take a closer look at the facts. We recently hosted a live debate around the question at the heart of Africa's industrial economic growth. Should investors be putting money into coal mines? Can coal and renewable energy be complimentary? Is clean coal a reality? Is renewable energy infrastructure affordable enough to discard coal? These proposals were intensely scrutinized.
