The government of Côte d’Ivoire has granted ASX/TSX-listed
gold miner Perseus Mining’s Ivorian subsidiary, Perseus Yaouré SARL its exploitation
permit to develop and operate its third gold mine Yaouré in Côte d’Ivoire. Located near the Ivorian capital of Yamoussoukro adjacent to
the Koussou hydro-electric power station, the Yaouré gold mine is expected to
become a large scale, low-cost gold mining operation that will form a core
asset within Perseus’s asset portfolio for many years to come. Receipt of the exploitation permit is the final permit that Perseus requires to start developing the Yaouré mine and follows Perseus’s recent announcements that it has accepted an offer of debt financing from a syndicate of international banks and confirmed its financing plans for the mine development. With all major prerequisites for the development of the
Yaouré gold mine now in place, the board of Perseus will convene in the very
near future to resolve to commence full scale project development. Perseus’s CEO and MD Jeff Quartermaine says: “The granting of the exploitation permit to enable
development of the Yaouré gold mine is a major milestone for Perseus that
firmly places us on the path to achieving our stated goal of producing more
than 500 000 ozs of gold at an all-in cost of less than US$850/oz from multiple
mines in several jurisdictions in West Africa.” “When developed, Yaouré is expected to be a large scale, low
cost mining operation capable of generating substantial benefits for all of
Perseus’s stakeholders, including not only our shareholders who have been
keenly awaiting this milestone, but also our host government and local
communities, employees and providers of a range of goods and services.” On behalf of the Board and the entire team at Perseus, I
thank the government of Côte d’Ivoire for granting us the exploitation licence
and in doing so, recognising Perseus’s credentials as a capable, reliable and
responsible participant in the Ivorian gold mining industry.”
