ASX-listed Universal Coal has reported its first complete quarter with EBITDA of AUD$22.5 million and a 4% increase in sales volumes. This equates to record
volumes of 1.85 Mt of product sold to market for the quarter ending March 2019. The current quarter EBITDA
decreased by 32% from the December 2018 quarter, negatively affected by the
downturn in the API#4 coal price during the last quarter. The previous quarter also
had the profit benefit of the coal inventory acquired as part of the
acquisition of the North Block Complex (NBC). YTD EBITDA totals AUD$76
million and is therefore well on target to reach the FY2019 forecast results of
AUD$93 million, despite the current negative API#4 coal pricing achieved. This is however offset with
the expected total sales volume increase from the original 6 Mtpa to 6.8 Mtpa. The increase in sales
volumes is contributed by increased efficiency at the NBC, and the consistent
increase in demand to Eskom from NCC. Group cash balance
increased by AUD$11.5million to a balance of AUD$58.3 million, bearing in mind
the delayed dividend distribution of AUD$10.5million payable to shareholders in
May 2019. The companyâ€™s cash balance
was affected by debt repayments of AUD$4million and the settlement of dividends
of AUD$1.4million in the quarter.
