Resources is excited to commence drilling this new opportunity at the earliest
possibility.” About Gaoual In April this year Lindian Resources signed an exclusive option agreement
with KB Bauxite Guinea and its sole shareholder Guinea Bauxite to acquire the
Gaoual project. Gaoual is one of only two
known major ‘conglomerate bauxite’ occurrences discovered in Guinea; the other
being Sangaredi – mined for approximately 30 years by Compagnie des Bauxites de
Guinée (CBG). Gaoual has very similar geological and geochemical characteristics to the Sangaredi conglomerate bauxite deposit, which was regarded as vastly superior to all other bauxite.
