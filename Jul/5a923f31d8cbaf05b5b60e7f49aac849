However, in Southern Africa, in semi-arid climates with low seismicity, upstream TSF’s are the dominant wall raising method.  This is a very cost-effective method of using the tailings to impound itself, where perimeter deposition results in a segregated beach of coarser tailings in the wall zone, and finer tailings and water in the basin. These have proven to be stable facilities when constructed within design limits, such as low rates of rising with minimal storage of water in the basin.  In other parts of the world, upstream TSF’s make use of compacted wall raises to progressively impound the tailings.  These too have been successfully used in most cases. Join Knight Piesold in a live interactive webinar where our experts will look at many new TSF’s being designed with barrier systems to minimise the risk of groundwater contamination.  Such lining systems introduce a weaker layer under the wall zone (depending on design) making it unsafe to design upstream TSF’s.
