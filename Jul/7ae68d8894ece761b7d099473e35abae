When:  4-6 September 2019 Where: Pan Pacific Hotel, Perth, Australia Website Africa Down Under (ADU) continues to deliver the leading forum for Australia-Africa business relations. While the conference was introduced to raise awareness of Australia’s interests in African mining and energy, ADU has grown to become the largest African-focused mining event held outside the continent itself, and its importance continues to be reflected in the number of high profile attendees we welcome year after year to Perth – Australia’s gateway to Africa, and Australia’s undisputed mining capital. Since the inaugural conference in 2003 ADU has assembled the best success stories from across Africa, and continues to demystify the notion that doing business in Africa is “too hard”. ADU has since become the MUST ATTEND event for those planning to invest in projects in Africa, who already have projects in Africa; or those interested in doing business in Africa. In addition to creating a melting pot for pro Africa-Australia relations, ADU forms the principal pillar of “Africa Week”, Australia’s week long celebration of the strong and growing business, social and cultural ties between Australia and the entire African continent. “Africa Week” comprises a full week of satellite events on research, education, infrastructure, sustainable development, capacity building, energy, movies and the arts. Join us on 4-6 September 2019 for the 17th edition of ADU, when Perth once again asserts its position as a global capital for African mining, as well as the driving force of Australian-African relations.
