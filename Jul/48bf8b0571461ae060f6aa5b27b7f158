Lycopodium Minerals has been appointed to complete the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) at Mali’s Lithium’s Goulamina project. With more 25 years’ experience in the development and execution of projects in Africa, Lycopodium has successfully designed, constructed and commissioned seven greenfield projects, and is also currently developing a further three process plants on the continent. Commenting on the appointment of Lycopodium, Mali Lithium MD Chris Evans said, “We are pleased to have secured a company of Lycopodium’s calibre, with a proven track record of delivering important pieces of work like the Goulamina DFS in a timely and efficient manner. “We look forward to working closely with Lycopodium over the coming period and we are excited by what the outcomes of this DFS will be.” World-class lithium deposit The Goulamina lithium project comprises a land holding of 100 km2 covering highly prospective hard rock lithium pegmatites in the Bougouni Region of southern Mali. Reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling has identified a number of sub-parallel spodumene-bearing pegmatites named Main, West, Sangar and Danaya (formerly separated into Danaya and Yando), which host the current mineral resource. Importantly, none of the pegmatites have been closed off at depth or along strike. Auger drilling shows that the Danaya pegmatites extend over a 2,6 km strike length, whereas only 1,6 km of strike has been drill-tested to date. There is a high probability that additional drilling will result in an expansion of the existing mineral resource and further enhance the already attractive economics of the Goulamina project.
