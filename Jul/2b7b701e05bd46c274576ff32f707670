Gwede Mantashe, minister of South Africa’s newly merged Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, or DMRE, has set aside R20 million in the current financial year to improve and develop an integrated licensing system over the coming two years. This announcement was made by DMRE minister Gwede Mantashe as part of the department’s 2019/2020 budget vote presentation. While a
large sum allocated to this initiative, it forms part of a much larger sum
allocated to developing and improving the mining sector. “R2 billion has been
allocated to mineral resources for the 2019/2020 financial year; of which 52%
goes to entities in our portfolio,” said Mantashe. Discussing
the issue of licencing in South Africa, Mantashe said: “We have made
significant strides in processing the backlog in licence applications, in our
Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West regions. These offices have now been reopened.” “Turnaround
times to process licence applications are under review. Timeframes must be
short, without having to effect major legislative amendments, by adopting more effective
and efficient internal processes. This will ensure that we are more responsive to
the needs and requirements of our applicants.” Discussing the merger of the mineral resources and energy
departments, Mantashe highlighted the need for the department to be more
efficient, “especially in these tough economic times. We must, nonetheless,
give practical expression to and execution of the electoral mandate to grow
South Africa.” “We must do so in line with the seven priorities outlined by the
President in his State of the Nation Address.” Merging the departments asserts their mutually reinforcing nature; and, thus enables streamlining of processes, integration in the value chain from upstream to downstream, and ensures alignment of the policy and regulatory framework for stability and investment, Mantashe noted. “Reconfiguration should result in a department that is adequately capacitated, efficient and responsive.”
