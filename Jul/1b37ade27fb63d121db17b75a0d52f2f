The privately-owned Managem Group has advanced its Tizert copper project, located in the Souss-Massa province of Morocco, to a bankable feasibility study. The company has also appointed engineering firm
DRA Global to conduct the BFS. The Tizert copper deposit is located on the northern edge of Igherm Precambrian buttonhole and is the largest copper deposit in the western Anti-Atlas Copper belt. This
underground mine project, with a targeted production of 3.3 Mt of ore per year,
is using multiple mining methods including room and pillar and long hole
stopping. An aerial
ropeway system will be used to convey the ore from the mine site to the process
plant site across an 800 m wide and 250 m deep canyon. The process plant will
be a flotation concentrator producing oxide and sulfide copper concentrates. DRA’s Montreal office has been awarded the full BFS scope which will include mining, backfill, ore transport, process plant and infrastructures. The BFS is expected to be completed in Q2, 2020. Pierre Julien, DRA’s executive vice president Americas attributes the winning of the contact to an excellent working relationship with Managem. “The DRA team has been working closely with the Managem leadership team for almost two years, and through a dedicated and collaborative approach has built a partnership which culminated with the award of this BFS contract”.
