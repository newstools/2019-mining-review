The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has approved ASX-listed African lithium developer Prospect Resources’ acquisition of an additional 17% of its Arcadia lithium project. This bodes well for improving the negative perceptions
investors have in Zimbabwe and the government’s ability to make decisions that
will drive investment into the country and its mining sector. On completion, Prospect Resources will increase its ownership in its Arcadia lithium project from 70% to 87%, and increase its share of future revenues and profits from the project’s strong economics. These economics includes: Says Prospect Resources’ MD Sam Hosack: “This transaction is value accretive for Prospect’s shareholders.
By acquiring Farvic’s carried interest we increase our share of revenues
without increasing our share of costs.” “Prospect is progressing discussions with multiple potential
financiers at a rapid pace and the company is focused on advancing Arcadia and
this transaction facilitates those discussions.” “The company has a number of value engineering activities currently underway that are expected to further strengthen Arcadia’s project economics.”
