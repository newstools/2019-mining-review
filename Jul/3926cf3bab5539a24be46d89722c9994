Mining Review Africa speaks to Eric Bruggeman, CEO of the SA Capital Equipment Export Council (SACEEC), about the new DRC Mining Code and its effect on South Africans doing business in the country and DRC Mining Week 2019. This year was the 15th anniversary event of DRC Mining Week. All metrics in terms of delegates, sponsors and high-level representation were smashed - cementing the country's potential as the future for mining on the continent. DRC Mining Week has grown with the mining industry and established its footprint in the country by engaging with the government and key stakeholders.
