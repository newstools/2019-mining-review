Judgement was handed down in the Mbombela High Court on 17 July 2019 in the matter between Flaming Silver and Vantage Goldfields SA, or VGSA. According
to VGSA, the ruling on Case No 859/2019 states that “Sale of Shares Agreement
of 1 November 2017 is declared null and void” and that “Prayers 2 to 4 of the
Notice of Motion in the main application are dismissed”. “Flaming
Silver is therefore ordered to pay the respondents' costs in the main
application,” a press release by VGSA states. “The
judgement is not only a victory for VGSA but also for all the people who have
suffered unnecessarily for the past 18 months.” “VGSA
has been vindicated by this judgement because the funding to re-open the mines
was never secured by Flaming Silver/SSC as alleged.” “VGSA
has significant support from the majority of stakeholders including, creditors,
ex-employees, the union and importantly the community. Stakeholders have been
constantly appraised of VGSA’s primary goal to ensure the re-opening of the group’s
mines. In this regard VGSA will be approaching the DMR with a full update and
proposal on the way forward.” As a result of the court judgement
VGSA says that it can now move forward with purpose and finalise the funding
arrangement in order to complete the business rescue the companies. The company said that meetings are scheduled with the new investors and the joint BRPs with a view to cementing a new sale agreement for the benefit of all stakeholders. Read a background news article: here
