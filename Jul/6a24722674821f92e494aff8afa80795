The Responsible Mining Foundation has published its new framework ahead of the release of the Responsible Mining Index Report, due in early 2020 – and notes that gender and human rights are two “cross cutting issues” for the mining industry. Gender and human Rights are consequently integrated throughout the framework. These transversal issues have been identified by the Responsible Mining Foundation (RMF) as areas of importance to responsible mining, particularly in the prevention, avoidance and mitigation of adverse impacts. The framework
document further provides a comprehensive reference of the major aspects of
responsible mining, based on society’s expectations of large-scale mining
companies on economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) issues. The RMI Framework 2020 includes
information on 43 topics grouped into six thematic areas: It
provides a brief overview of each topic, the indicators, metric questions, and
kinds of evidence used in the RMI Report to assess the policies and practices
of mining companies. The
RMI Framework 2020 is an exhaustive resource for all stakeholders, including
companies, investors, civil society, governments and supply chain customers on
what responsible mining should look like. It will also soon be available in
Bahasa Indonesian, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish. “We are delighted to share this comprehensive
reference tool with all stakeholders in support of constructive engagement and
responsible mining worldwide,” says Hélène de Villiers-Piaget, CEO of the RMF. The RMF
is an independent research organisation based in Switzerland. It encourages
continuous improvement in responsible minerals and metals mining with an
emphasis on leading practice and learning.
