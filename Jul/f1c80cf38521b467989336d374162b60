Protecting systems and appliances from electromagnetic interference has become more important than ever whether from a safety or a service excellence perspective. In rail industry terms these application areas could include the electromagnetic compatibility of rolling stock apparatus; signalling and telecommunication equipment or emissions from fixed power supply installations in a maintenance depot. In terms of electrical power supply, it is essential to provide reliable Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) protection from the current source to the end user or the consumer. It is with this protection in mind that MARECHAL Electric offers a range of EMC plugs and sockets-outlets incorporating DECONTACTOR (integral switching capacity) technology up to 250A. Frequency-controlled drives can thus be connected, measurement data be safely transmitted and components can be disconnected and replaced with peace of mind. DECONTACTOR EMC plugs and socket-outlets are manufactured with metal casings and installation accessories, with customised gaskets housing metallic tissue to ensure excellent EMC performance. Supplied as automatically watertight, the EMC range boasts high performance silver-nickel butt contacts ensuring constant contact pressure and optimal conductivity even after thousands of operations & intensive operation.
