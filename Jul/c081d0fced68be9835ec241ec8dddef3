ASX-listed Azumah Resources has confirmed a high-grade underground mineral resource at its Bepkong deposit, giving a tremendous boost to its fast evolving Wa Gold Project in Ghana. Ghana – Azumah Resources findings point to 279 700 oz grading 3.59g/t Au, including a combined measured and indicated resource of 167 500 oz averaging 4.05g/t Au. Company MD, Stephen Stone, added: “Total mineral resources at Bepkong have more than doubled to 517 600 oz and overall project mineral resources have increased by 11% to 2.8Moz. Importantly, none of the underground mineral resource is incorporated into our current 1Moz ore reserve or into our feasibility study, which is scheduled to be completed by year-end. “A scoping study evaluating
underground mining at Bepkong will be reported later in July and our
expectations are that this could have a materially positive impact on what is
an already financially robust project. “With the prevailing gold price well above the
US$1,300 per oz used in determining ore reserves, the case for development
becomes even more compelling and, looking to the longer term, we still have
many additional shallow and deeper targets to evaluate within our
regional-scale 2,400 km2 of prospective tenure.” About Wa gold project The Wa gold project is located in the
Upper West Region in the far northwest of Ghana along the border with Burkina
Faso. The project comprises the three separate tenement blocks. The Wa-Lawra block in the west covers a large area of approximately 2177 km² located to the west and north-west of the town of Wa. The Wa East block includes the Josephine and Julie- Collette licence blocks located east of Wa.
