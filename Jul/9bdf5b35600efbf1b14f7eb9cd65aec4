"In the ten years since we founded Toro Gold, the management team has taken a greenfield exploration discovery through to a highly successful producing mine which is testament to the quality and professionalism of the Toro Gold team. "I am delighted that we will be joining an excellent company in Resolute who share our vision of a professional approach to value creation in the sector. The contribution of our highly profitable Mako gold mine and prospective exploration portfolio with Resolute Mining’s portfolio of large scale, long life assets creates a compelling African gold investment proposition. "I believe the enlarged group offers significant benefits to our existing stakeholders, partners and host governments across Africa through the creation of a larger, more financially robust company with better risk diversification. "I would like to add my personal thanks to the many people that have contributed to the success of Toro Gold and look forward to the next stage of the group’s evolution as part of the enlarged Resolute Mining group.”
