Labour union,
Solidarity, has strongly condemned the adoption of the controversial National
Health Insurance (NHI) plan by the cabinet. Solidarity argues the government clearly only wants to achieve an ideological victory even if it is at the expense of South African’s lives. Morné Malan, senior researcher at the Solidarity Research Institute (SRI), said that health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize’s recent comments that the time for discussions, analysis and diagnosis was over and that we should go ahead with the implementation, are irresponsible and that the NHI is heading for disaster. “I can understand why the minister would want us to stop
analysing, because every economic analysis, every failed pilot project and
discussion only reveal more shortcomings that would hamper the system, and are
further indications that the NHI simply is not viable.” A step in the wrong direction Solidarity added that the NHI  represents a drastic and very real step in the
wrong direction. “The status quo can be improved upon but even the current
state of affairs would be more desirable to most South Africans than to
monopolise health in the hands of the state,” Malan explained. “Looking at the feedback coming from all quarters, spanning
the Treasury, the business sector at large (such as mining houses, auditing
firms and even including medical aid schemes and administrators), the
pharmaceutical industry, private hospital groups as well as organised labour
and from various think tanks, among so many others, then one cannot but reach
the conclusion that a total revision or a rejection of the proposal is called
for. “There is virtually no chance that this version would offer a significant improvement. We also see it in government’s unwillingness to engage with reasonable analysis and its pressing on with the bill, regardless of the consequences for ordinary South Africans,” Malan concluded.
