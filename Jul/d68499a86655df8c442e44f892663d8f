Siyakhula Sonke Empowerment Corporation CEO, Fred Arendse explains: â€œThe last time we appeared in the Mpumalanga High Court court, on 19 June 2019, the matter of the sale of Lily and Barbrook was postponed as a result of an application tabled. The matter had to be postponed to allow us to submit answering papers to that amended point. "On Monday, 1 July 2019, another application for leave to appeal the judgment in terms of which the intervention application was dismissed and in addition Vantage Gold Fields South Africa brought an application for leave to subpoena the directors of Flaming Silver in order to lead evidence in respect of the amended point. "The Judge stated, before proceeding with the matter, that the matter has had too many delays given the urgency of the matter, that Lily Mine is of public knowledge and interest and that the matter will be finalized, including the main application."
