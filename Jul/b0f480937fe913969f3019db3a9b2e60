Dual-listed Orion Minerals has completed issuing shares to South African institutional investor, the Anglo American sefa Mining Fund, or AASMF – which now owns a 3.7% stake in Orion. Launched in 2003, the AASMF is a joint initiative between
Anglo American Zimele and Small Enterprise Finance Agency (sefa) formerly known
as Khula Enterprise Finance, a government-owned entity that promotes small and
medium enterprise development. As a value-adding relationship investor, the AASMF helps
such mining enterprises that applied before March 2017 with equity and loan
finance at prime interest rates p.a., complemented by technical support during
the high-risk exploration and pre-feasibility stages of projects – which can
get extremely complicated. Essentially, this Fund brings its beneficiaries’ businesses
to commercially bankable positions at which point such beneficiaries can
approach lenders and raise finance to get their mining operations commissioned. AASMF subscribed for 15.75 million redeemable preference shares in Repli Trading No 27, a 73.33% owned subsidiary of Orion Minerals, in November 2015 at a subscription price of R1 per redeemable preference share as part of a seed capital investment with the previous owners of the Prieska copper-zinc project. Orion is looking to re-start mining at  Prieska, situated in the northern Cape. AASMF agreed to the redemption of the preference shares, in
exchange for ordinary shares in Orion, the parent company of Repli. Under the terms of the share exchange agreement and
following the receipt of Orion shareholder approval at a meeting held on 7 June
2019, Repli has voluntarily redeemed the preference shares in consideration for
Orion issuing the shares to AASMF. No funds were raised from the issue of the shares.
