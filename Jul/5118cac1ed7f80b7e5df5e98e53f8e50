AIM-listed diamond producer Firestone Diamonds has recovered a 54 carat intense fancy yellow, sawable diamond from its Liqhobong mine in Lesotho. “The Liqhobong mine has become known for its fancy yellow stones but this one is the largest we’ve recovered so far and is therefore quite special,” says Firestone Diamonds CEO Paul Bosma. Although
certain segments of the diamond market are currently struggling, the demand for
unique natural stones remains positive,”
he says. The 54 carat diamond will go on sale at the next tender scheduled to take place during September 2019. The recovery of its latest fancy yellow diamond follows the recovery of a 72 carat diamond which was recovered together with a 22 carat makeable white stone, followed by an 11 carat fancy light-pink stone in April. These diamonds were sold in May 2019. Despite Liqhobong’s mainstay production comprising smaller, lower value diamonds, the mine does produce higher value, special diamonds. During FY2018, a number of high value stones were recovered at Liqhobong. This included its largest stone to date (a 133 carat gem quality stone that sold for $0.9 million); its second most valuable stone to date (a 45 carat white that sold for $1.2 million); and the highest dollar per carat for a stone to date (a 4 carat fancy pink, which achieved a sale price of $112 781/carat).
