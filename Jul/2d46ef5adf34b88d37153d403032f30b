TSXV-listed minerals explorer Giyani Metals Corp. has received final approval from the Department of Environmental Affairs in Botswana to implement its environmental management plans at its K.Hill and Otse manganese prospects.  Botswana – This final approval was granted after the customary one-month public review process during which the Giyani Metals Corp. was required to advertise the details of the EMPs in the government gazette and local newspapers. The public review process commenced on 7 June and concluded on 5 July 2019 and there were no concerns raised by any stakeholders for either sites during that period. Giyani Metals Corp. submitted three initial EMPs for its Botswana manganese prospects K.Hill, Otse, and Lobatse, in late 2018 and early 2019. The company further submitted updated EMPs based on comments and clarifications from the DEA on the first submissions. On May 22, 2019 Giyani Metals Corp. received DEA initial approvals for
the K.Hill and Otse EMPs clearing the way to the public review advertisement,
the last step in the process. The company still awaits the initial approval of its third EMP for
Lobatse which was resubmitted on 24 June 2019 with responses to comments from
the DEA. “We are extremely pleased with the final
K.Hill and Otse EMP approvals and grateful to the DEA in Botswana for the speed
and dedication to achieve these approvals,” says Giyani Metals Corp.CEORobin Birchall. “This has been a detailed process with
multiple review and update steps that started back in late December 2018. “We can now shift our focus to the implementation phase to start the remediation work at K.Hill and Otse which will improve the environmental conditions at both sites. At the same time this work will enable us to process the resulting material and generate revenues to facilitate the development of the overall project,” Birchall concludes.
