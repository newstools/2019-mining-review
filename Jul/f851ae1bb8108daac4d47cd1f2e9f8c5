A comprehensive review of mining tax incentives in 21 countries found that more than half offer a complete exemption from corporate income tax for nine years on average which poses significant economic threat to those countries. The new research from the Intergovernmental
Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF) provides
the most granular view of tax competition in mining yet,
showcasing how common tax incentives are in mining. This is of particular concern in African countries, which are more likely to grant incentives in mining contracts than the primary law, raising concerns about the potential for corruption. “Resource-rich countries compete to attract
mining investment but run the risk of offering unnecessary or poorly designed
tax incentives,” says Alexandra Readhead, technical advisor on tax and
extractive industries, IGF. “The use of tax incentives may lead countries
to forgo vital mining revenues in exchange for unknown benefits - revenues
which are needed to fund public services and infrastructure.” It is particularly concerning that more than
half of the countries surveyed offer a corporate income tax holiday either in
the law, or in one or more mining contract. Statutory tax holidays are provided
for in Ecuador, Madagascar, Niger, and the Philippines. Tax holidays in mining
are problematic for two reasons: “In certain cases, tax holidays last longer than the average life-of-mine, meaning governments may never collect income tax,” explains Readhead. “Tax holidays in mining are extremely costly for governments and can negatively impact communities surrounding mining projects.” The IGF Mining Tax Incentives Database, a collection of files comparing the fiscal regimes of 104 mining projects across 21 countries, is the first large-scale, systematic attempt to compile tax incentives used by developing country governments to attract mining investment.
