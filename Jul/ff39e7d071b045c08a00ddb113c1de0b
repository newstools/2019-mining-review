ASX/NSX-listed Bannerman Resources has advised that the section 232 trade investigation into uranium imports into the United States has been resolved with a clear and positive decision by President Trump. Bannerman’s CEO, Brandon Munro, says: “We welcome the strong and decisive resolution of the section 232 trade investigation, which has been a distraction to the sector for 18 months. “This no trade action outcome maintains open access to the US uranium market and is particularly positive for non-US uranium companies. “With a renewed focus on supply diversity and geo-political risk, Bannerman is particularly well positioned with its Etango Project situated in Namibia, a premier uranium development jurisdiction with good bi-lateral relations with all major consumption markets, including the US, China, Russia and France. “Bannerman is set to benefit from renewed market activity, with an advanced project of world-class scale in a premier jurisdiction and robust cash balance.” Highlights
