Rio Tinto has decided to curtail operations at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa to ensure the safety and security of its employees due to an escalation in violence in the communities surrounding the operations. There has been an escalation of criminal activity towards Richards Bay Minerals employees and one was shot and seriously injured in the last few days. As a result, all mining operations at Richards Bay Minerals have been halted and the smelters are operating at a reduced level, with a minimum number of employees now on site.
