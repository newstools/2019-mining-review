The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) has published updated guidance Handling and Resolving Local Level Concerns & Grievances: Human Rights in the Mining & Metals Sector,which integrates the eight effectiveness criteria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The guidance, which was first published in 2009
and updated this year, also shares good practice on how mining and metals
companies should design effective mechanisms to systematically handle and
resolve community concerns or grievances, and provides practical tools to
support companies with implementation. ICMM company members recognise the importance
of undertaking meaningful stakeholder engagement and commit to implementing the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Tom Butler, CEO at ICMM, says: “Demonstrating transparency and accountability is fundamental to meaningful engagement with host communities. "Effective grievance mechanisms are a key part of a company’s responsibility to respect human rights and can benefit both the company and host community by providing channels for resolving issues and building trust. "I hope that ICMM’s updated guidance will become an effective tool that responsible companies can use to put this into practice.”
