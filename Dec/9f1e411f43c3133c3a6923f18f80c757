South Africa’s unprecedented move to Stage 6 load shedding on the evening of 9 December after Eskom declared a power system emergency due to a shortage of generation capacity saw two South African mining companies resultantly close their underground mining operations. READ MORE: Why mines should consider natural gas as an energy source Diamond miner Petra Diamonds has received a notification from Eskom requesting that it reduce load to ‘essential loads level’, with the result that Petra is in the process of halting its diamond mining operations in South Africa, which include the Cullinan, Finsch and Koffiefontein mines. Production, hoisting and
processing have stopped with immediate effect on the evening of 9 December and
the company is in the process of removing all people from
underground, except those required for essential services, with only pumping to
prevent flooding and ventilation for safety being allowed. Meanwhile, gold miner Harmony Gold Mining Company has called off its underground shifts due to continued load shedding. The company also received a request from Eskom on the afternoon of
9 December to lower its power consumption. Harmony has therefore reduced power
consumption at its South African operations to levels required only for the
maintenance of emergency services. In the interest of safety and due to reduced power supply, night
shift employees at Harmony’s South African underground operations did not go
underground on the evening of 9 December and the 10 December day shift
employees, similarly, will stay on surface. “We will resume shifts as soon as Eskom is able to provide us with the assurance that power supply will be more reliable,” says Peter Steenkamp, CEO of Harmony.
