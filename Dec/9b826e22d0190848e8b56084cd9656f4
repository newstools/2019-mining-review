A state-of-the-art smart blasting system was officially handed over to the Wits Mining Institute (WMI) in November 2019 by electronic blast initiation specialists, DetNet. DetNet’s BlastWeb system has been installed in the mock mining operation on the Wits West Campus, and promises to boost both research capacity and learning at the university.

According to WMI director Professor Fred Cawood, the system will be a vital resource for Masters and PhD students in mining engineering. “Blasting and explosives is a very specialised field, and BlastWeb will allow researchers to conduct a range of tests using the system,” says Professor Cawood. Key research areas that will benefit include: the relationship between blasting and seismicity; optimal rock fracturing using explosives; and safe, controlled blasting practices. He says that access to the system gave Wits a significant resource in helping the industry realise its goal of Zero Harm. “Electronic blasting from a control room puts distance between mine workers and risk,” he continues. “The system also has a powerful analytics element, so workers can ‘inspect’ the quality of the blast from the control room.” Professor
Cuthbert Musingwini, Head of the School of Mining Engineering at Wits, highlights
the teaching value of the donated equipment. The installation of DetNet’s BlastWeb system as part of the WMI facilities is a welcome development for the Wits School of Mining Engineering,” Musingwini enthuses. “It provides our students with access and good visual exposure to the concept of smart electronic blasting techniques.” According
to DetNet CEO Gys Landman, the company is committed to future research on
digital and autonomous mining technologies. “For
this reason, DetNet welcomed the invitation from the WMI to contribute to the
further expansion of the Sibanye-Stillwater DigiMine. The DigiMine initiative
creates an opportunity for DetNet to form a research partnership with WMI – to support
further post-graduate research into the use of digital technologies in future
underground mining,” Landman highlights. Worth around R100 000, BlastWeb comprises a blasting control unit (BCU), a terminator connecting the BCU to the detonators on the development end, and a tagger which assigns unique locations to the detonators. The BCU has been installed along the crosscut of the mock tunnel at Wits, with 43 dummy detonators connected to the development end. The system’s hardware and software are installed in the Wits Mining Institute’s DigiMine control room, providing the analytics from each simulated blast. Communication between the BCU and the control room is carried by the Wits ethernet. Landman
notes that BlastWeb is one of the industry’s leading digital blasting systems,
and is successfully used in global underground mines. “We also see additional value in exposing undergraduate students to electronic blasting systems and the use of digital technologies in these applications. "As they enter their careers, current undergraduates will face a mining environment that increasingly embraces digital technologies,” Landman concludes.
