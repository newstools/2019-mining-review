Prospect Resources has signed a secure power supply agreement with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission & Distribution Company for the supply of power to the Arcadia Lithium Project. Arcadia’s primary source of power supply is from the existing Lake Kariba hydroelectric power station, whose main power distribution lines run adjacent to Arcadia, some 15 kms away via the Atlanta substation.
