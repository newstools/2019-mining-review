Resolute Mining has announced exploration results from its 2019 drilling campaigns in Mali. Drilling has been focused on expanding Mineral Resources at Syama satellite prospects. The positive results received will expand sulphide resources at Tabakoroni as well as build on the open pit oxide Mineral Resource inventory at Tabakoroni, Cashew and Paysans.

and CEO, John Welborn, is pleased by the continuing exploration success at
Syama: “We
continue to receive excellent high-grade intersections from drilling at
Tabakoroni. We remain confident that further drilling will expand our
underground resource model and form the basis of a future high-grade
underground mine. “Of
equal importance is our success in growing available oxide resources. Open pit
mining at Tabakoroni is exceeding expectations with high grade ore resulting in
record production from the Syama oxide processing circuit in 2019. “The
success of our regional oxide exploration programs provides obvious opportunity
to extend the oxide mining inventory. “Resolute Mining controls 80 km of greenstone belt strike along the prolific Syama shear zone. Exploration on our tenements at Syama has already defined more than 10 Moz of gold. “We expect our investment in exploration at Syama to accelerate in 2020 with strong cashflows from both the oxide and sulphide processing plants.”
