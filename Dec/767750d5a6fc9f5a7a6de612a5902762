IronRidge Resources reports that drilling has commenced at the Zaranou gold project in Côte d’Ivoire. The license borders with
Ghana and is along strike from significant operating gold mines including Chirano
(5 Moz), Bibiani (5.5 Moz) and Ahafo (17 Moz). Commenting on the company’s latest progress at Zaranou , Len Kolff, COO of IronRidge, says: “The team has done a
great job in completing drill planning, community consultation and drill access
construction in time for the arrival of the Geodrill rigs, whilst continuing
mapping, soil sampling and drone survey field activities. “We are excited to get the drill programme underway, to test below the extensive hard-rock artisanal mining zones with high-grade channel sampling results, as well as discrete magnetic anomalies spatially associated with the mineralised structures targeted by the artisanals. Read: more about gold mining “It is a challenging task, as the area is vast, with over 40 km strike of alluvial workings within which the artisanals have discovered and defined 16 km strike of in-situ mineralised structures, of which we are testing approximately 8km strike within the most intensively pitted zone. Read more about mining in West Africa “We believe the wide
spaced AC drill traverses across the width of the mineralised corridor, in
conjunction with targeted deeper RC holes, will provide us with the best chance
of testing the structures across strike and at depth at this early stage of
exploration across a large area. “We look forward to keeping the market updated on progress and anticipate receiving results during Q1 2020.”
