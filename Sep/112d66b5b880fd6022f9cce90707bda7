Tancoal Energy, the 70%-owned subsidiary of Intra Energy Corporation and 30% the National Development Corporation received the attached notification from the Ministry of Minerals, Mining Commission of Tanzania directing Tancoal to charge royalty to customers on their cost of transport. The following summarises the impact on customers and gives a background to the royalty issue: Tancoal has been producing and selling coal in Tanzania since 2011. Acacia Mining resumes gold export from North Mara Coal from the mine is transported 52 km to the sales point at Kitai where
the coal undergoes final processing and is then loaded onto customers trucks
Free On Transport, which is where change of ownership takes place. Royalties have always been paid at the sales point where the Government
calculates the royalty and issues an invoice for payment. Three independent law firms and a report received in July 2019 from the Attorney General all agreed that this was the proper interpretation of the law. In addition, Tancoal has gone through numerous Government audits over the
past 8 years, from agencies such as the Tanzania Revenue Authority, Tanzania
Minerals Audit Agency and the Tanzania National Audit Office which have never mentioned
this procedure as being incorrect. The Attorney General has now recalled his July report and has changed the
ruling to state that Tancoal is not in compliance with the law and should
charge royalty on the transportation of the coal to the destination, wherever
that may be. Tancoal has been notified by the office of the Ministry of Minerals that the law must be implemented by 15 September 2019 otherwise trucks will not be allowed to leave the sales point. The company continues to discuss this matter with the Government and customers to find a solution. Tanzania 16% free carry legislation to affect Peak Resources?
