Altus Strategies has announced that it has defined Diba SW, a potentially significant new prospect at the Diba gold project. Diba is strategically located 13 km south of the multi-million ounce Sadiola gold mine, in the world renowned ‘Kenieba Window’ gold belt in the west of the Republic of Mali. Steven Poulton, CE of Altus, comments: “We are very encouraged by the discovery of the Diba SW prospect, which is located just 0.5 km to the south west and directly along strike of the historic Diba resource area. "The prospect is defined by a discontinuous 1.2 km long gold in termite soil anomaly along the flanks of a ferricrete caped ridge and is also coincident with a VTEM geophysical anomaly. ‘’Based on the discovery of Diba SW, we have reinterpreted the historical geochemical, geophysical and topographical data at Diba. This work has defined at least three further potential prospects, increasing the total number of new prospects at Diba to six.

The project hosts a near surface, shallow dipping, historical oxide resource with a number of exceptional drill intersects, including 5.02 g/t Au over 20.0 m and 5.36 g/t over 13 m.

However, while we recognise that Diba may be a potential source of future oxide feed for Sadiola, we also consider it has significant standalone oxide and growth potential.”
