Canadian gold producer SEMAFO has set the 2019 exploration budget for the Karankasso portion of the Bantou project at $5 million. Burkina Faso – With the addition of the $5-million provision for Karankasso, the 2019 exploration budget for the Bantou project in Burkina Faso increases to $16 million, and SEMAFO’s 2019 total exploration spend to $32 million.

number of soil anomalies, many of which are located along the Karankasso trends
that host the existing 805 000 oz inferred mineral resource. In July 2019, an 8 500 m drill programme was launched to explore
potential new structures parallel to the Karankasso trends. The programme,
which was suspended for the rainy season, will resume shortly and will be
followed by an additional 22 000 m reverse circulation drill campaign in the
fourth quarter to explore untested soil anomalies along the Karankasso trends. The objective of the 2019 Karankasso programme is to identify new
mineralisation that can be delineated and added to the resources base in 2020,
in line with SEMAFO’s objective of reaching 2.5 Moz to 3 Moz of resources by
the end of 2020. When compilation of Bantou-Karankasso group data is complete, it
will be considered as a single project, namely the Bantou project, which will
culminate in a consolidated NI 43-101 resource estimation for the combined 1 250
km² land package at the end of the year. “Bantou is our top development project, and
our exploration team has already begun more intensive work on the Karankasso
portion,” says SEMAFO VP for exploration Richard Roy. “A total of four drill rigs are currently turning on Bantou, and our resource goal of 2.5 Moz to 3 Moz by the end of 2020 is well within reach. The next 18 months will be an exciting time for Bantou,” Roy concludes.
