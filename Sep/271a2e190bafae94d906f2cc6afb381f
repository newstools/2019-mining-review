Botswana Diamonds, the AIM and BSE listed diamond explorer has announced that pioneering geophysical work has identified what is believed to be kimberlite pipes buried at shallow depth on its Thorny River ground. The targets identified are very similar to the pipe that constituted the high-grade and famous De Beers Marsfontein mine, in so much as the pipe had little surface indication due to dolerite rock cover but grew and swelled below the dolerite. Botswana Diamonds raises funds for Thorny River Much of the Thorny River area geology is comprised of a dolerite dyke swarm. John Teeling, chairman, comments: “It has long been held that there should be high grade kimberlite pipes other than the Marsfontein mine in the Thorny River area. "The geology made discovery difficult. New geophysical technology tries to see through the dense dolerite cover. "The company pioneering the work, Subterrane, believe they have identified five targets likely to be kimberlites. "We are working to better define where to drill. The targets are shallow so will not be expensive to drill”. Conventional geophysical techniques have been unable to detect kimberlites under the dolerite including  those that are deeper seated. Subterrane, a partner using its proprietary technology, enables the company to explore geophysical anomalies beneath the dolerite and those that are buried.
