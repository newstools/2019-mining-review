ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company and its project partners have reported record monthly diamond production results from both mines for August 2019. The record monthly production figures for Lulo and Mothae come on
the back of the Company’s growth-focused strategy, leading to the scaling up of
production at both mines to maximise revenue generation and returns. Lulo alluvial mine, Angola (Lucapa 40% and operator) Lucapa launches next phase of exploration at Lulo The Lulo mine in Angola, the world’s highest average US$ per carat alluvial project, produced 3,180 carats in August, the highest monthly result since production commenced in 2015. A significant factor contributing to this record was the monthly
grade of 13 carats per 100 m3, which is almost twice the planned
grade of 6.7 m3. Significantly, these high grades were achieved from two of the
flood plain blocks being delineated at Lulo, including new Mining Block 19
situated between the prolific Mining Blocks 8 and 6. These new mining areas have no noticeable prior artisanal
activity, and the results give Lucapa and its partners further confidence that
the extensive flood plain areas along the ~50km stretch of Cacuilo River still to
be explored have the potential to increase diamond resources and mine life. Mothae kimberlite mine, Lesotho (Lucapa 70%) EXCLUSIVE: The magic of Mothae Lucapa’s new high-value Mothae 1.1 Mtpa kimberlite mine in Lesotho, which commenced commercial production in January 2019, produced two records during the month of August. A monthly processing record of 120,736 tonnes treated was achieved, recovering a record 2,911 carats, taking year to date carat production to 17,935 carats.
