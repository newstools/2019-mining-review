TSX-listed GoviEx Uranium announced this week that the government of Niger has formally approved the revision of its Madaouela I mining permit to include an additional 23.84 Mlb (million pounds) of measured and indicated mineral resources at the company’s flagship Madaouela uranium project. Niger – The approved revision now includes an additional 5.96 Mlb U3O8 in the measured and indicated categories associated with the Miriam uranium deposit as well as 17.88 Mlb U3O8 in the measured and indicated categories associated with Madaouela South North East (MNSE) deposit. In addition, the government has confirmed the environmental and social impact assessment certificate for the Madaouela I mining permit also covers both the Miriam and MNSE deposits.  As this mineralisation is not in a proven and/or probable mineral reserves category, these mineral resources have not been included in the economic technical study included in the 2015 prefeasibility study. GoviEx Uranium chairman Govind Friedland added: “These 23.84 Mlb of measured and indicated mineral resources were discovered and delineated by GoviEx’ geologic exploration team. “As
a result of this focused effort as well as the company’s continued social and
environmental work and support and cooperation with the country, these
resources are now included in the Madaouela 1 mining permit. “We warmly welcome this significant milestone, as we advance the optimisation work and the de-risking efforts of the targeted mineral resources contained within the Madaouela project.” Read: GoviEx Uranium receives US$220 million interest in Madaouela About GoviEx Uranium GoviEx is a mineral resource company focused on the exploration and development of uranium properties in Africa.
