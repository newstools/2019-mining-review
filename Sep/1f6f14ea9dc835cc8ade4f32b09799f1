“We remain optimistic of the potential to deploy solar in remote locations, and feel our Nomad solar tracker is uniquely placed to service this market.” Cambridge Energy Partners has signed of a cooperation agreement with Scatec Solar, a large Norwegian independent power producer. Under the agreement, Scatec Solar will use CEP’s movable solar tracker to offer short-term off-take agreements to commercial and industrial customers worldwide. Webinar recording: Battery Storage in remote locations "The collaboration with Scatec Solar is an important step in CEP’s evolution, and puts us in position to become the leading manufacturer of movable solutions worldwide” said Tom Miller, CEP’s CEO. “We remain optimistic of the potential to deploy in remote locations, and feel our Nomad tracker is uniquely placed to service this market.” 400 MW of solar energy a boost for mining in DRC Nomad is a prefabricated and movable generator that uses single-axis  tracking to maximise solar yield. The prefabricated trackers can be rapidly installed in modular 15 kW units, reducing installation costs for large scale projects in challenging locations. With a market leading transport density of more than 150 kW per container, units can be packed-up and redeployed multiple times over their useful life. CEP’s Nomad passed strict due diligence by Scatec and its advisory, proving that the pioneering solution is technically sound. The collaboration with Scatec allows CEP to significantly increase the future production volume of its Nomad tracker to hundreds of Megawatts (MW) per year. “CEP’s modular and movable Nomad will help us rapidly deliver projects to the previously under-served commercial and industrial market. "This technology complements our redeployable solution, Release, and supports the expansion into this market” says Hans Olav Kvalvaag, responsible for Release in Scatec.
