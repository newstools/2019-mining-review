NYSE-listed Accenture has collaborated with Exxaro to help digitally transform its business and unlock new revenue streams. This will be achieved by managing the migration of its SAP solutions, and other centrally-run applications used by Exxaro business units, to Microsoft Azure. This supports Exxaro’s ambition to establish a secure, agile, cost effective and scalable platform that will improve business processes and continuity. Belfast coal mine to produce coal six months ahead of schedule Accenture created a cloud transformation strategy for Exxaro that defined the business case for migration to a public cloud, a move, which offered the lowest total cost of ownership, improvements to core systems resiliency, and the agility needed to meet customer demands. In line with Exxaro’s requirement for a swift and secure transition, Accenture designed and built a cloud platform in the South African Azure data centers. This included optimizing Exxaro's SAP systems to take advantage of cloud architecture benefits and building a more resilient and available architecture to improve business continuity. Accenture then seamlessly migrated Exxaro's enterprise applications, which included more than 280 Microsoft Windows virtual machines, onto Azure with minimal disruption, while also integrating multiple remote mining locations in South Africa. Exxaro shareholders reap rewards of a profitable coal business Accenture will run, secure and continually optimize Exxaro’s cloud environment in collaboration with its cloud management organization. This will provide resource visibility, management consistency, and operational control for cloud optimization and scale, amidst changing business needs. “Accenture’s deep expertise in leading on SAP and other application migrations to Microsoft Azure means that Exxaro will benefit from a more secure, scalable and agile operating environment that is more cost effective than standing up a new on-premises data centre,” says Desmond Govender, Group Manager, Information Management, Exxaro. “This will improve business processes and continuity, as well as free up resources to focus on achieving superior business outcomes.” Pradeep Roy, Cloud Advisory lead for Accenture in Africa, adds, “Exxaro's decision to move to the cloud puts them in a strong position for greater efficiency and innovation. "This approach to transformation will deliver a competitive advantage on a secure cloud platform, enabling them to flex based on business demand and accelerate innovation.” EXCLUSIVE: Women in mining – wisdom from the front line Exxaro selected Accenture for its strong technical knowledge and capabilities, robust partner ecosystem, local expertise and its deep experience implementing large-scale cloud migrations.
