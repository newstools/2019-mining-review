Stornoway Diamonds owns and operates the Renard diamond mine. The mine produces very high yield and contains a high level of internal and external dilution, which can make up to 30 to 40% of the feed to the plant. This resulted in high energy costs and tremendous wear and tear on the equipment from crushing high volumes of waste material that is not diamond bearing.

TOMRA developed the solution for Stornoway Diamonds with four key objectives for the ore sorting plant: The ore sorting circuit features five TOMRA PRO Near Infrared (NIR) sorters, which are particularly well suited to enable discrimination between the various ore and waste materials based on their different chemical composition. The plant’s large diamond recovery circuit also included a TOMRA COM XRT 2400 sorter, which uses X-Ray Transmission technology to separate material according to its specific atomic density. “The TOMRA solution we have in operation has offered us a very low-cost, efficient reliable means of recovering our coarse diamonds without inefficiency, without causing diamond breakage,” concluded Marie-Claude Hallé. “It’s a very neat way to get those diamonds out of the Kimberlite at the very early stage of the process. We reduce our power consumption cost, we reduce our wear and tear on material.”
