ASX-listed coal miner Universal Coal has executed a Coal Supply Agreement with Eskom for 100% of its production from its fourth operation Ubuntu colliery. Under the agreement, the Ubuntu colliery will deliver 1.2 Mtpa of
thermal coal to Eskom with first coal delivery set for November 2019, with
build-up of production over a short six-month period. This increase in sales volume underpins the company’s confidence
in reaching its annualised sales target of 9.6 Mtpa to market by FY,2021. Commenting on the coal supply agreement, CEO Tony Weber says: “We are delighted to have this agreement concluded with Eskom. The
agreement ensures continued growth of guaranteed revenues in the face of
fluctuating export thermal coal markets, and enables Universal to continue to
fund further development and grow returns to shareholders.” Ubuntu is located within ~20 km of Universal Coal’s Delmas-based
Kangala colliery and hosts a JORC compliant thermal coal resource of 75.8 Mt of
which 31.7 Mt is measured. Learn more: Another coal junior cuts a deal with Eskom Learn more: Why coal is so important for South Africa’s future energy needs Ubuntu is fully permitted and the surface rights have already been
