The Carlyle Group has acquired a majority stake in IsoMetrix through their $698 million Carlyle Africa Fund. Madison Park Group served as exclusive financial advisor to
IsoMetrix on the transaction and existing shareholders and management retain a
significant stake in the business. This investment will equip IsoMetrix for
further growth, enabling the company to compete more aggressively for outright
leadership within the EHS and integrated risk management software arena through
accelerated software development. The acquisition also offers synergies with
occupational health and safety (OHS) risk management solutions provider NOSA -
another recent Carlyle Group acquisition. The company and NOSA will continue to operate independently. However, they will collaborate in developing and cross-selling to enterprise clients across mining, oil & gas, power and transport sectors offering a suite of technology-enabled managed solutions designed to address environmental and occupational health and safety risks.

IsoMetrix has offices in South Africa, the
USA, Canada and Australia and was recently included in the 2019 Verdantix EHS
Leaders Quadrant. The Carlyle Group will support the
continued growth of IsoMetrix and NOSA through its Sub-Saharan Africa fund and
its global network. As companies face increased scrutiny of their Environmental, Social & Governance performance, IsoMetrix is well-positioned to provide relevant metrics, data-driven insights and expert advice on sustainability and corporate responsibility.
