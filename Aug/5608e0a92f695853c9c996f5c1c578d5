AIM-listed Botswana Diamonds has renewed two prospecting licences in the country’s Kalahari Desert. Licences PL232 and PL235, held by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary Sunland Minerals, have been renewed to 30 September 2021. These key licences,
covering just over 500 km², are strategically located in the central Kalahari
Desert west of the Ghaghoo diamond mine. Botswana Diamonds has already
identified prospective drill ready targets. The intensive work included
aeromagnetic surveys, ground magnetic surveys, soil sampling and target
selection. Analyses of concentrations
of Kimberlitic Indicator Minerals (KIM's) on the licences indicate proximity to
kimberlite pipes, which regional geology suggests may be attractive in size and
grade. Read more about Botswana Diamonds' operations Botswana Diamonds is already in extended discussions with a major international diamond producer to joint venture the next phase of work on these strategic licences.
