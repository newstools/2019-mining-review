The Guarantee allows ISI’s project financing to advance towards completion. ISI’s senior debt facility will be utilised to construct a power plant at Colluli. ISI will utilise a Build Own Operate Transfer model. The BOOT model diversifies project risk by utilising the experience of proven operators. ISI’s power generation solution is designed to match the Front End Engineering Design power requirements and has been integrated into the FEED results. The Guarantee is separate from CMSC’s project financing requirements and does not represent an increased debt obligation for CMSC.
