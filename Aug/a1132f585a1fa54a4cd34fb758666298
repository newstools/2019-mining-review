Sahamamy, the first of six planned flake-graphite production plants modules to be built in Madagascar, is on target to achieve full capacity in Q4, 2019. Shishir Poddar, Tirupati Graphite Executive Chairman and MD, says: “With Sahamamy achieving almost 75% of its target production rate and the construction of the 6,000 tpa module in Vatomina well underway, we are on track to deliver the 2019 milestones on schedule and within budget in Madagascar. "Furthermore, the start of production and launch of  ‘CarboflameX’ from the Patalganga flame retardant graphite plant, illustrates our ability to climb up the value chain ladder, thereby firmly positioning ourselves as a specialist flake graphite company supplying to the extensive arena of fast-growing end markets.
