Predictive Discovery has welcomed ASX-listed Resolute Mining as its new JV partner on its Cote D’Ivoire Joint Venture following RSG’s takeover of Toro Gold. The current Toro Joint Venture covers 2,344 km2 in
granted permits including the key gold exploration projects of Ferkessedougou
North, Boundiali and Kokoumbo. The first two projects have enjoyed recent drill success
including 45.3m at 3.16g/t gold from Ferkessedougou North and 27 m at 2.42g/t
gold from Boundiali with new zones of gold mineralisation discovered on both
projects. Once the transaction is approved, Resolute Mining will hold a
70% stake in the joint venture with Predictive holding 30%. Paul Roberts - Predictive Discovery MD comments: “Following Resolute Mining’s announcement of the Toro
acquisition last week, I have met with senior Resolute management to discuss
the future of our joint venture projects in Cote D’Ivoire. “Based on these early-stage discussions, I am confident that
the joint venture relationship will continue on the same excellent terms we
have enjoyed with Toro Gold Limited over the past four years. “Moreover, a partnership with a large, successful and
well-funded Perth-based mining company with a clear focus on expansion in West
Africa is a definite positive for Predictive and its shareholders. “We look forward to ongoing productive discussions with the
Resolute team and continuing rapid progress on the key joint venture targets in
Cote D’Ivoire – Ferkessedougou North and Boundiali. “We note that 4,290 m of drill results are pending from the
recent Boundiali RC drill programs and that detailed soil sampling on
Ferkessedougou North to identify new Ouarigue-South style mineralised granite
bodies continues. “More positive news flow on the Cote D’Ivoire Joint Venture is therefore expected over the coming weeks and months.” Read more about gold projects in West Africa:
