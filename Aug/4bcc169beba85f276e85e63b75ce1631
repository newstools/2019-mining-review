by the level of support received during the SPP and the subsequent top-up
placement and I would like to thank existing shareholders for their ongoing
support and welcome new investors to Volt’s register. “Importantly, this funding allows the Company to reduce its short-term debt and to advance its development funding initiatives that, once executed, will very quickly see work on the Stage 1 development of our Bunyu project get underway. “We remain committed to securing our Stage 1 development capital in the near-term and I look forward to providing further updates to shareholders in due course.”
