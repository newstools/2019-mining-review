Dear Colleagues, Contractors and Community members It is with great pleasure that I share the first edition of Zikhiphani eZAC with you. It has been in the pipeline for some time but today I am very proud that it has become a reality. As the name suggests, the purpose of Zikhiphani eZAC is to provide updates to all stakeholders about what we are doing to take Zululand Anthracite Colliery (ZAC) forward. Since Menar, our main shareholder, acquired the operations in September 2016, it has been a great challenge to take ZAC from the status of bankruptcy to a sustainable mining operation that contributes to the wellbeing of our host communities. It has not been an easy task. It required a huge effort from our shareholders, employees, unions and community members working together. This has given ZAC a new lease of life. Legacy issues from previous owners has made engaging with communities a challenging task at times, but with the assistance of the Future Forum Committee members as well as the support from the Amakhosi from the Mlaba, Matheni, Mandlakazi and Zungu traditional councils, many breakthroughs have been made and the way forward looks promising.
