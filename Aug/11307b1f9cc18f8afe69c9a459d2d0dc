ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company and the GoL have announced the recovery of an exceptional 64 carat diamond from the Mothae kimberlite mine in Lesotho. The mines ownership compromised Lucapa 70% and  Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho (GoL) 30%. Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall says the Type IIa D colour gem is considered the best individual diamond recovered to date from the new Mothae mine, further underlining its status as a source of large and premium value stones. “The recovery of this exceptional 64 carat gem also represents a great start to our mining campaign in the higher margin zones in the southern pit at Mothae,” says Wetherall. In line with recent guidance, the commencement of dewatering of the southern pit into the main 500 000 m3 water dam currently under construction has enabled mining to transition to this higher margin zone of the kimberlite pipe in Q3, 2019. Mining is scheduled to continue in the southern pit throughout 2019. Read more about Lucapa's Mothae diamond mine here
