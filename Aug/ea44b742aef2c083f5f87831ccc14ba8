Clients include leading blue-chip companies such as WBHO, Concor, Anglo American, De Beers, and Thyssenkrupp. “We have been deploying the Passport 360 solution for all of our contractor onboarding requirements for the past four years. This solution has allowed Amplats to leverage the ability to manage compliance. Passport 360 provides a system that lends structure, in addition to approvals by line management and reporting tools to know the status of our onboarding compliance. It allows contractors to upload their competencies and medical certificates remotely, without having to travel to and from the mine itself,” according to Yolande Koekemoer, Contractor Management Coordinator, Mogalakwena Complex, Amplats. The benefits of Passport 360 include companies being able to track their training and medical expiry dates. They can also upload equipment and link them to an individual, and pull extensive reports and maintain compliance. The section called Vendor Match offers the option of searching for employees when there are any vacancies. Workflows can be processed, enabling electronical approval of forms, documents, and access request forms, etc. Policies and procedures can be placed on Passport 360 for easy access, while contracting partners can also post their own policies and procedures on their profile for their own use. Messages can be sent to contracting partners by the contractor management department, and all can read these via their own system. Messages can also be sent by contracting partners to their own employees using their Passport 360 profile internally.
