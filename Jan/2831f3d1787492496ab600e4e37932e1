AIM-listed Botswana Diamonds has undertaken a share placing with existing and new investors to raise £370 000 via the issue of just over 67.2 million new ordinary shares. Botswana
– The funds raised will be used to fund exploration activities during the
current year in Botswana and South Africa, which remain ongoing, and to provide
additional working capital for the company. Each placing share has one warrant attached with the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share at 0.6p per new ordinary share for a period of two years from 23 January 2019. Botswana
Diamonds is advancing towards diamond production at the Thorny River project in
South Africa having concluded a mining contract with Palaeo Minerals covering
both bulk sampling activities and potentially future full-scale mining services
at Thorny River. Following
the release of a technical and economic evaluation report on Thorny River in
June 2018, Botswana Diamonds and its partner Vutomi have been considering a
number of options to advance the property, concluding with the company signing
the contract with Palaeo – who is an experienced mining contractor with several
mining contracts in South Africa and Zimbabwe. The
contract will enable Botswana Diamonds to self-fund the Thorny River project
from bulk sampling through to mine development, assuming positive results. “We are
confident that Thorny River could be the first diamond producing project for
Botswana Diamonds. A royalty bulk sampling/mining model means that we have no
capital expenditure apart from a limited in-fill drilling programme in
early-2019,” says Botswana Diamonds chairman John Teeling.
