The 2019 edition of Mining Indaba is expected to be bigger and better than ever before. Not only will this be the 25th anniversary of the event, but it is also the year in which the implementation of the event’s turnaround strategy, aimed at taking the event back to its investment roots, will truly begin to bear fruit, CHANTELLE KOTZE writes. “We have spent the past two years turning the ship around and have finally started driving it forward,” saysMining Indaba director of content Harry Chapman, who enthusiastically notes the return of the event’s core focus of being the convenor of the world’s largest mining investment conference that provides access to capital for African mining companies.
