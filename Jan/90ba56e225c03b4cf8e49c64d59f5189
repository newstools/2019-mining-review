Roytec Global had a highly successful 2018, in which the company exceeded its goals and laid solid foundations for its future. The rapid emergence of battery mineral projects (lithium, cobalt and graphite) have dominated the separation industry sector in 2018 and new mine and project funding in this sector has been buoyant. Coupled with this, the growing influence of Chinese technologies in western minerals projects (not only battery mineral projects) has changed the dynamics in the industry. Roytecâ€™s business strategy and product offering was influenced by these trends and has resulted in Roytec consolidating its partnerships with leading Chinese technology and equipment suppliers. Under these partnerships, Roytec has formed specialist teams to provide experience, expertise and innovation to clients with battery mineral studies and projects. Prominent product lines for the year included: Roytec exceeded its revenue goal of R400 million in 2018. Moreover, Roytec opened an office in Perth, Australia to service its growing client base. This will allow the company to back-up its equipment with locally stocked OEM spare parts for rapid delivery to clients and attend to emergency call-outs and routine scheduled maintenance work. Following the strong 4-year relationship with the China-based Toncin Group, a Roytec office was also opened in Yantai, China to support its growing supply chain from China, with permanent QA/QC and engineering presence.
