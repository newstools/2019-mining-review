TSXV-listed Alphamin Resources Corp. has successfully commissioned the processing plant front-end crushing circuit at the flagship Bisie tin project in the DRC in January 2019, on schedule. The processing plant front-end crushing circuit includes the
primary crusher, two tertiary crushers and the screening buildings. Ore is now
being fed through this circuit to create a stockpile with which the gravity
circuit can be commissioned. The process plant in its entirety is planned to be
commissioned, on track with the original schedule by the end of March 2019. Moreover, the underground mine capital footprint was
completed at the end of December 2018, two months ahead of schedule. The run-of-mine
ore production rate is being ramped up to approximately 1 000 tpd to achieve
the targeted steady-state feed rate to the processing. It is envisaged that
the processing plant should ramp up to its nameplate production capacity of tin
concentrates from April 2019 to the end of June 2019. As was previously announced, Alphamin Resources’ subsidiary ABM (Alphamin Bisie Mining SA) has drawn on the total available debt package of US$80 million and this together with the previous capital raisings are expected to fund the project to production, bar any unforeseen events. “To have achieved such significant progress to date on time
and within budget for a project of this scale, in a challenging environment, is
a testament to the skill and dedication of our staff and contractors on the
ground. We look forward to the commencement of tin concentrate production in
the near future and will keep the market appraised of developments in this
regard,” says Alphamin CEO Boris Kamstra.
