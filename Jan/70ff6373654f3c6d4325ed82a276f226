IAMGOLD Corporation has entered into a forward gold sale arrangement with financial institutions whereby the company will receive a prepayment amount of $170 million. IAMGOLD will receive a repayment in exchange for delivering 150,000 ounces in 2022, with a gold floor price of $1,300 per ounce and a cap price of $1,500 per ounce. This Prepaid Gold Arrangement (Prepay)  is supported by a syndicate of banks including Citibank N.A. and National Bank of Canada. The collar on the prepay at the time of delivery of ounces occurs as follows: “Entering into the gold prepay provides additional liquidity to IAMGOLD at attractive terms to support the execution of the company’s growth strategy, while also mitigating any downside price risk below $1,300 an ounce on 150,000 ounces of production,” comments Carol Banducci, EVP and chief financial officer.
