 The National Union of Mineworkers, or NUM, has voiced its frustration and concern that the business rescue practitioners have not paid its members’ salaries in the past two months at Optimum and Kroonfontein operations. Both mines are owned by the Guptas. "As we begin 2019 employees will be going for the third
month without being paid their salaries as the business rescue practitioners (BRPs)
gave unlawful instruction that employees should not report to work which goes
without saying that come end of the month employees will not be paid their
salaries," says Tshilidzi Mathavha, NUM Highveld Regional Secretary.

"This, of course, becomes a burden to workers whom by nature and character
survive by selling their labour to their employer. What is of great
concern is the fact that BRP's always gave false hope to the union as if the
situation was under control only to find that there is no money," Mathavha
adds.

It remains questionable regarding the company stance that there is no cash flow
to sustain the business after their commitment that for as long as there is
production, the business can be sustained until the process of rescuing the
business is finalised. “The NUM is unable to accept the lip service from
the employer since the operation is up and running.”

The NUM has now engaged with the DMR on a possible way forward to which the DMR
has assured the NUM that the process has since been restarted which will be
completed by end of February 2019.

The NUM is currently engaging the same BRPs to do what is expected of them and
pay salaries to employees. "The NUM regional leadership collectively are
putting necessary pressure to its head office to engage all role players and
find a solution. This is a collective matter and members should desist from
blaming an individual as the cause of delays," Mathavha concluded.
