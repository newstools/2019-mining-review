Robert Friedland and Yufeng “Miles” Sun, Co-Chairmen of Ivanhoe Mines extend their congratulations to Felix Tshisekedi on his inauguration as the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “On behalf of everyone at Ivanhoe Mines, we congratulate Tshisekedi and we salute the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their insistence on a peaceful and democratic transfer of power,” says Friedland. “We are confident that the trust placed in Tshisekedi by the citizens of the DRC will inspire him to continue important efforts in promoting the unity of his country, leading it on the path of prosperity, security and empowerment for its people. “We also recognize outgoing President Joseph Kabila's commitment to democracy in becoming the first President in DRC history to cede power peacefully through an electoral process. "The DRC attracted significant foreign direct investment during Kabila’s presidency, which resulted in strong economic growth and transformed the DRC. “This is a time of tremendous opportunity for responsible development of the mining sector in the DRC. We look forward to working with Tshisekedi in meeting the challenges before us, in the same warm spirit that has marked the relations between Ivanhoe Mines and the DRC government and its people for so many years. “Ivanhoe Mines also looks forward to work together with all members of government, the Governors and relevant officials in Lualaba and Haut-Katanga to advance our world-class Kamoa-Kakula copper project and the historic Kipushi zinc-copper-germanium-silver mine,” adds Friedland.
