Vedanta Zinc International is maintaining momentum in bringing to life its US$400 million Greenfield Gamsberg zinc mine, located in South Africa’s Northern Cape. Work over the past six months has been progressing well - having achieved first zinc in metal concentrate production in September 2018, the project is currently ramping up to full production which it aims to achieve within the next six to nine months, writes CHANTELLE KOTZE. Gamsberg, host to the world’s largest undeveloped zinc resource, expects to add up to 250 000 t of zinc to the company’s annual production when Phase 1 of a potential three phase mega project, reaches commercial production later this year. This is only the first step, and will act as the anchor for growth in Vedanta Zinc International's (VZI) journey to become a 1 Mtpa zinc producer through the creation of an integrated, safe and sustainable Southern African zinc cluster. The project’s development up to this stage has not been smooth sailing, admits VZI CEO Deshnee Naidoo, who has led the development of the Gamsberg project since joining the company in 2014. “When VZI broke ground at Gamsberg in 2015, zinc prices fell as low as $1 400/t. "Despite this, the company forged ahead with advancing the project, made possible by the company’s flexible development approach, which allowed for adjustment of the pace of development to stay in line with market conditions and affordability. "With this approach VZI managed to decelerate and accelerate the project so that the development timelines were actually no worse off than the timeline the company originally committed to in November 2014 – despite delays resulting from a weakening of base metal prices in 2015 and 2016 and the resultant limited access to funding,” says Naidoo.
