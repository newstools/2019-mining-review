Lucara Diamonds' inaugural diamond sale through Clara Diamond Solutions, its 100% owned digital sales platform, was successfully launched and final matching was completed on 16 December 2018. A total of seven manufacturers participated in the sale, five of whom matched and received their orders. All told, diamonds successfully matched to orders generated revenue of US$660.865, achieving +8% over Lucara’s market price and +15% over Lucara’s reserve price for these goods. Goods of approximately similar value have been set aside for the next sale, scheduled to take place later this month. Diamonds will be added onto the platform in the coming weeks gradually, as additional manufacturers are on-boarded and in response to increasing variety and size of orders received. In time, as supply and demand is optimised, Lucara will progress into continuous sales of appropriate, qualifying goods through Clara. Further, Lucara will continue to augment its overall sales strategy through a combination of Clara and its regular tender process. “This trial sale marks a momentous milestone for Clara. On November 30, Clara successfully initiated its inaugural diamond sale with positive results, confirming that the platform is commercially viable," comments Lucara CEO Eira Thomas. "Though we are delighted with the prices achieved for the rough diamonds sold in this first sale, Clara’s longer-term value will be realised through its’ scalability, increasing the volume of rough diamonds transacted by adding production from other global diamond producers. "Onboarding of additional manufacturers is continuing and Lucara is in active discussion with a number of leading diamond producers who are also interested in trialing the platform in 2019.
