South African coal producer Exxaro believes investment is needed to help drive a brighter future and has committed R20 billion to building and expanding its production portfolio. Investment in South Africa’s mining sector has dropped significantly over the last few years – driven by political uncertainty and a general lack of confidence in the country. It’s not all bad news however. Local coal producer Exxaro recognises that strong investment is needed now to help drive a brighter future for the country and its people. As such, the company has committed R20 billion to building and expanding its production portfolio in the short to mid-term future, executive head of projects and technology JOHAN MEYER tells LAURA CORNISH and CHANTELLE KOTZE.
