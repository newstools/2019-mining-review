Africa focused Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation or JOGMEC will be setting up an office in Johannesburg, South Africa from 1 February 2019, bringing its number of international offices to 14. “Recognising the immense
potential which Africa has in supplying the world with natural resources,
JOGMEC entered into a mutual partnership with South Africa and has several
joint ventures in place with other African countries which ensures a stable
supply of natural resources to Japan. The company deals in the
mining and procuring of oil, gas, cobalt, nickel, copper, platinum group metals
and various rare metals. It also contributes to the financial and technical
development of the countries which supply Japan with the minerals and
resources. JOGMEC has offices in Moscow;
London; Middle-East; Vancouver, Sydney and Washington to name a few. “As the need to power more electric vehicles and smart devices grows, so will the demand for precious minerals, which are vital components in the working of most electronic devices. Positioning JOGMEC in South Africa gives the entity a strategic advantage of being able to grow its business interests in Africa, whilst also advancing the needs of the host countries. JOGMEC has interests in coal and natural gas development in Mozambique as well as the geological and geophysical surveying of petroleum in Kenya. But the Japanese owned entity has had its footprint on African soil as far back as 2008 when they established a Geologic Remote Sensing Centre in Botswana. The company has been involved
in technology transfer of satellite image analysis for mineral resource
exploration, and the development of human resources for member states of the
Southern African Development Community（SADC). By
opening the Johannesburg office, JOGMEC will continue to exert synergy, grow
mutual relationships with its African and world partnerships whilst continuing
to provide a secure and steady supply of resources to Japan.
