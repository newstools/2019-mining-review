The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum has approved the mining
agreements for TSXV-listed East Africa Metals East Africa’s 100% owned Mato
Bula and Da Tambuk gold projects located in the Tigray National Regional State
of Ethiopia. The final step in the mining licence process is the formal
ratification of the mining agreements by the ethiopian council of ministers. Andrew Lee Smith, East Africa’s CEO states: “The Ministry of Mines approval of the Mato Bula and Da
Tambuk mining agreements advances two additional mining projects to the
development stage. This is another important milestone achieved by East Africa
in the emerging mining sector of Ethiopia.” With this completion East Africa now has three advanced
development gold projects in close proximity to each other and existing transportation
and power infrastructure. The company will continue to engage in discussions
with interested parties on project financing and advancing engineering of the
Mato Bula and Da Tambuk projects.
