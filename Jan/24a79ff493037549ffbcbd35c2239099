West African gold explorer and developer Azumah Resources advises that two additional drill holes at its Kunche deposit have extended high-grade mineralisation. West Africa - Azumah Resources' Kunche deposit have extended high-grade mineralisation up to 75 m deeper, to approximately 200 m below surface, where it remains open. “This is a tremendous start to 2019 with our 40,000 metre, multi-objective drilling campaign still having a long way to go," comments Azumah MD, Stephen Stone. “Our much-anticipated update on the progress of the Feasibility Study and ore reserves is just weeks away and we are very confident this will be a defining year for the Wa gold project and Azumah’s shareholders," he adds. KRCD849 returned 5 m at 6.02 g/t Au from 214 m, which is approximately 75 m below the excellent intercept obtained by KRCD831 of 44 m at 5.37 g/t Au. The Kunche deposit is consistently mineralised over its 1.5 km north-south strike. This most recent drilling, along with drilling undertaken earlier in 2018, has confirmed that this consistency also extends to depth, as is the case with most structurally controlled, orogenic-style gold deposits. Further confirmation of this depth continuity is also forthcoming from a second hole, KRCD850, drilled on a section 75 m to the south of KRCD849. This hole returned a spectacular intercept of 1 m at 140.49 g/t Au from 208 m, which represents more than four ounces gold per tonne.
