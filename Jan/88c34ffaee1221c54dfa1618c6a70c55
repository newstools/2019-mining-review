Sibanye-Stillwater is benefiting significantly from the higher palladium, and more recently PGM basket, prices.  The palladium price has increased by more than 75% from US$744/oz to over US$1 300/oz,
since the acquisition of Stillwater was announced on 9 December 2016. The
current 2E PGM basket price of US$1 190/oz is 19% higher than the average 2018 2E
PGM basket price of US$996/oz. Higher
basket prices, together with increased production due to initiation of mining
operations in a second stope block at Stillwater’s Blitz operation in October
2018, is expected to positively impact revenue at the US PGM operations. 2E
PGM mined production for 2018 is expected to be approximately 590 000 oz,
in line with guidance for the year. The South
African PGM operations continue to perform well, with 4E PGM production for
2018 expected to be approximately 1.17 Moz, ahead of published annual guidance
and costs at the bottom end of guidance. The
robust palladium and rhodium prices (up more than 40% in US$ terms in 2018),
together with the weaker rand:dollar exchange rate (depreciating by 16% during
2018), boosted the rand 4E PGM basket price by 19% during the course of the
2018 year to more than R15 700/oz, significantly enhancing
revenue. Approximately
74% of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA in the first six months of the year was
derived from the PGM operations, increasing to 85% in Q3, 2018. In Q3,
2017, PGMs contributed 49% of Group adjusted EBITDA. The
strategic benefits of the Group’s commodity and geographic diversification are
clearly evident, with operational disruptions in the gold division offset by
rising PGM prices and the solid operational performance of the PGM operations.
