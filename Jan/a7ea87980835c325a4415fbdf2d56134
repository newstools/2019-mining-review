JSE/NYSE Sibanye-Stillwater advises that following an application for leave to appeal by AMCU of the judgment made by the Labour Court on 21 December 2018 and confirmed by the Court on 8 January 2019, the union affiliation verification process, facilitated by Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, which was due to continue today, has been suspended pending the outcome of the appeal process. Sibanye-Stillwater is confident that the that the verification exercise will confirm that three other unions which signed the wage offer, represent more than 50% of employees in the workplace, therefore supporting the extension of the offer in terms of Section 23(1)(d) of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 and will oppose the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union's (AMCU) attempts to avoid the verification process. Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye-Stillwater comments: “We are disappointed that AMCU continues to pursue these obstructive actions and delay the conclusion of the ongoing strike, while its members are suffering severe financial hardship as a consequence. "We are not surprised by AMCU’s behaviour and have considered other legal alternatives, which we will be pursuing.”
