TSX/NYSE-listed Eldorado Gold has announced the its fourth quarter and full year 2018 production results and preliminary cash costs. “In 2018, Eldorado successfully met its overall production goals, which included two upward revisions to production guidance," says George Burns, Eldorado's President and CEO. "These positive results reflect solid execution by the team and better-than-expected leach pad production at Kisladag. "In addition, underground mine development and refurbishment of the Sigma Mill at Lamaque proceeded according to plan and we expect to commence commercial production at Lamaque in the first quarter of 2019. “The Olympias team made good progress addressing challenges relating to the blending of the ore feed to the mill and start-up of the newly installed paste plant. "Ore feed blending impacted metallurgical performance and contributed to lower second half production and higher costs. "With better control of the blend anticipated, we expect 2019 to be a better year for both mining and processing at Olympias. "Overall, our progress through the year has been substantial as we continue to make decisions about our portfolio to create maximum value.” Eldorado is a gold and base metals producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey, Canada, Greece, Romania, Serbia, and Brazil.
