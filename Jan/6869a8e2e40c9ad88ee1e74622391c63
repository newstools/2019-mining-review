Does coal have a place in Africa's future energy mix? Join us for a live debate around a question at the heart of Africa's industrial economic growth. In the first of a series of collaborative webinars between ESI-Africa and Mining Review Africa, we'll hear from a panel of industry experts and open the floor for discussion with the live audience. Should investors be putting money into coal mines? Can coal and renewable energy be complimentary? Is clean coal a reality? Is renewable energy infrastructure affordable enough to discard coal? Join the debate! The webinar will be moderated by Mining Review Africa editor Laura Cornish - who will also be chairing a session on this topic atInvesting in African Mining Indaba  - and ESI-Africa editor Nicolette Pombo-van Zyl.
