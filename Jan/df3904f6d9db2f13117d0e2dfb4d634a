ASX-listed mineral explorer Predictive Discovery is mourning the death of a senior employee following a security incident at its Progress Minerals Joint Venture in Burkina Faso. Employed by Progress Minerals, Kirk Woodman was kidnapped
from an exploration camp at Tiabongou, Burkina Faso, near the town of Mansila
on 15 January. His body was found on 17 January. Predictive Discovery extends its deepest sympathies to the family and colleagues Woodman – a respected geologist with 20 years of experience working on the ground in West Africa. “Kirk’s expertise, professionalism and love of his work and
passion for West Africa was obvious to all who knew him. We support Burkinabe
and Canadian government efforts to bring those responsible for this terrible
act to justice,” says Paul Roberts, MD. The ongoing safety and security of every individual involved
in the joint venture managed by Progress Minerals is of paramount importance to
both companies. All local employees of the joint venture company Predictive
Discovery SARL are safe and secure after the incident. Predictive is monitoring the ongoing security situation in
various regions of Burkina Faso and will work with Progress Minerals to assess
the implications for its local project activities. The incident does not affect any other Predictive operations
or interests. The company has not previously acknowledged the security
incident at the request and advice of various governments involved.



Predictive retains a 49% interest in the Progress Joint Venture, which
covers 11 exploration permits in Eastern Burkina Faso.
