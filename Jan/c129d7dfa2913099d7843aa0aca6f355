Diversified natural resources producer Eurasian Resources Groupâ€™s
Metalkol Roan Tailings Retreatment project, or RTR, has joined that Cobalt
Institute. The Metalkol RTR is a major reprocessing plant for historic cobalt and copper tailings from previous mining operations in the Haut-Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A hydro-metallurgical facility owned by Eurasian Resources Group is set to become one of the most significant producers of clean cobalt globally. At full capacity, Metalkol RTR will be able to
supply over 120 000 tpa of copper cathode and 24 000 tpa of cobalt, volumes
sufficient to build more than three million electric vehicles per year. The project is nearing completion and is expected
to reach initial production rates early in 2019. The Cobalt Institute, a non-profit trade
association composed of producers, users, recyclers, and traders of cobalt, promotes
the sustainable and responsible production and use of cobalt in all its forms.
