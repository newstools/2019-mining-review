Cora Gold, the LSE-listed West African focused gold explorer has appointed Wardell Armstrong International as independent consultants to undertake a preliminary metallurgical test work programme at its Sanankoro gold project in Mali. The test work programme has been designed to assess the amenability for cyanide leach extraction of gold from oxide mineralisation at the project, which has an exploration target of 1-2 Moz of gold with significant upside as independently determined by consultants SRK Consulting (UK). The test work, which will consider both cyanide-in-leach
(CIL) and heap leach gold extraction technologies, will be conducted at Wardell
Armstrong International’s laboratory facilities in the United Kingdom. It will use two composite samples of approximately 80 kg
weight each that have been recently collected from core holes drilled at the
“Zone A” and “Selin” prospect areas at Sanankoro.  Results are expected during Q2 2019. Jonathan Forster, Cora Gold's CEO, commented, “We are pleased to appoint Wardell Armstrong International as our independent consultants for this preliminary metallurgical test work programme which is intended to provide initial guidance on methodology for future potential gold extraction at Sanankoro.” “This programme is running in parallel with a drill
programme, already underway, that is aimed at outlining areas of higher grade
that may present potential starter pits for any future mining project.” “We are delighted to kick off the year with an active work
programme and I look forward to reporting the results of the metallurgical test
work targeted for Q2, 2019, as well as drill results as and when they become
available.” The test work programme has been designed to assess the
