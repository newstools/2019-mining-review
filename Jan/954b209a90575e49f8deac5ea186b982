Diversified mining company, South32, has made changes to the leadership team, in the roles of CFO, and chief marketing officer. Katie Tovich will succeed Brendan Harris as CFO
from 1 May 2019, while Harris will take over from Peter Finnimore as chief marketing
officer assuming responsibility for South32’s commodity marketing and supply
functions. To ensure a smooth transition, Tovich will immediately assume the role of deputy CFO, while Harris will move to marketing from 1 July 2019 to work with Finnimore to enable handover of South32’s global customer relationships. “These appointments mark the culmination of a
succession process that highlights the diverse talent within our organisation,
whilst broadening the skills and experience of our leadership team,” says South32 CEO Graham
Kerr. “With more than 25 years’ experience in the
global resources industry in senior finance and marketing roles, including
setting up and leading our treasury function, Katie Tovich is ideally placed to
lead our finance team and continue our disciplined approach to capital
management,” adds Kerr. “Brendan Harris [who was appointed CFO in
November 2014] was an integral member of the leadership team that established
South32 and has been an outstanding CFO overseeing our strong balance sheet and
predictable returns to shareholders. Brendan’s extensive financial and market
experience will be invaluable as he moves into the role of chief marketing
officer,” Kerr noted. Meanwhile, Peter Finnimore established
South32’s marketing team, creating a fit-for-purpose, commercially focused
function. “With a career spanning more than 25 years, he has forged strong
relationships with our customers and played a key role in reshaping the market
pricing mechanism for alumina. While Peter will remain chief marketing officer
for a transitional period, I would like to take the opportunity to thank him
for his contribution to South32 and wish him well in his future endeavours,”
says Kerr.
