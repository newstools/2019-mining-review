The voluntary suspension is requested pending an announcement by Cape Lambert Resources regarding its Kipushi Cobalt-Copper Tailings Project located in the DRC. Pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 17.2, Cape Lambert Resources has requested to extend the current voluntary suspension in respect of its ordinary shares, effective immediately. The company notes that government elections have been underway in the DRC with the government elect recently been announced. The occurrence of these elections has caused delays in the communications with the DRC and the ability of Cape Lambert to finalise matters in relation to the Kipushi Project. It also informs shareholders that samples from the Kipushi Project are currently been assayed with results expected in the coming week. The company requests that the voluntary suspension remain in place until the earlier of the release of the announcement, or prior to the commencement of trading on 5 February 2019. Cape Lambert is not aware of any reason why the suspension from quotation should not be granted or of any other information necessary to inform the market about the suspension.
