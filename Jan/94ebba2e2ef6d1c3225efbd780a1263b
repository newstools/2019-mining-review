Lucara Diamond Corp. has recovered a 240 carat, top white gem diamond, from its 100%-owned Karowe diamond mine located in Botswana. This diamond will be shown alongside the 127 carat, top white gem diamond recovered earlier this year together with other exceptional diamonds recently recovered from Karowe, at Lucara’s upcoming diamond tender closing on 7 March 2019. Since mining began at Karowe in July 2012, a total of 54
diamonds in excess of 200 carats have been recovered, including 12 diamonds
larger than 300 carats in size. In addition, Lucara has sold 180 diamonds in excess of US$1
million each and ten diamonds have sold for in excess of $10 million each. “This top white 240
carat gem diamond was mined from the M/PK(S) unit within the South Lobe,
providing continuing confirmation that large, high quality gem diamonds are
recovered throughout the kimberlite, in all lobes and phases on a regular
basis,” says Lucara CEO Eira Thomas. “As Karowe enters its seventh full year of production, the regular recovery of Specials (diamonds>10.8 carats) continues unabated and in line with expectations,” Thomas notes. In 2019, mining at Karowe will be largely focused on the high value south lobe, including contributions from the newly refined EMPKS unit which is now understood to be the source of both the historic 1109 carat Lesedi la Rona and the 813 carat Constellation, which sold for a record US$63.1 million. The Karowe diamond mine currently boasts open pit reserves of 2.6 million carats extending out to 2026 and is in the process of completing a feasibility study that could expand mining underground to 2036 and beyond.
