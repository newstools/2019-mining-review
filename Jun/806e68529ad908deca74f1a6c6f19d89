South Africa’s newly appointed Mineral Resources and Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, stated at the Junior Indaba that he favours coal-fired power over other resources. During his address to attendees in Johannesburg Mantashe asked investors to speak to the Council for Geoscience (CGS), which falls under the minerals and energy department as it has found new sources of coal. However, he also expressed interest in finding common ground, stating: “To me, it is not about killing coal and growing renewables, but about promoting various technologies at our disposal. There is a combination and a co-existence of the various technologies.” During the Junior Indaba media briefing, Mantashe quelled fears stating that he is familiar with the contents of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Junior miners are calling for a transparent cadastre system with freely available geological information. Minister? @GwedeMantashe1 @JuniorIndaba @DMR_SA pic.twitter.com/CffLKgqvKA The debate on renewable energy, is about promoting the various technologies at our disposal & ensure that there is a combination & coexistence of the various technologies. The industry must also invest in finding clean coal energy technology. #JuniorIndaba #InvestinSAMining pic.twitter.com/KHjAA4efta We've just interviewed @VuslatBayoglu from @menarsocial at @JuniorIndaba #JuniorIndaba for our YouTube channel.

The industry cannot do everything on its own. We need to work together. If we are patient with one another, we will do much better for the country. We need to increase mining contribution to the GDP pic.twitter.com/LZj93CHFyd Junior miners are calling for a transparent cadastre system with freely available geological information.
