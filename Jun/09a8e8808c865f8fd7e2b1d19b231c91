The Executive Committee of the WFDB gathered at the Israel Diamond Exchange in Ramat Gan with one of the major issues discussed being the impact of synthetic diamonds on the global diamond industry. In a special address to the
meeting, Martin Rapaport, Chairman of the Rapaport Group, explained that melee
goods have been losing value since January and that there is a serious concern
that prices for this category of goods of lower quality and purity will decline
further. World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) President Ernie Blom says: “The WFDB is not opposed to synthetic diamonds as such on the market. They should, however, always be disclosed so that consumers know exactly what they are buying, and so that there is no confusion between real natural stones and lab-growns. “At the same time, the
consumer should be aware that synthetic diamonds will not hold their value over
time as their production capacity is unlimited. “Unlike real gemstones, the value of synthetic diamonds will not be forever, and they do not express the same emotion of ever-lasting love and passion.” The Executive Committee discussed how the trading of synthetic diamonds should be organized in the most appropriate way at WFDB-affiliated exchanges. Currently, the diamond
exchanges in India, Israel and Hong Kong prohibit trading in synthetic diamonds
on the floor of their diamond exchanges. Yoram
Dvash, President of the Israel Diamond Exchange and host of the meeting of the
ExCo, commented: “In the coming months, diamond exchanges will develop specific
communication programs on social media to promote our diamond business.
Consumers should be aware of what they are buying as well as what the intrinsic
value is of the product they are embracing. “Through targeted campaigns on social media, it is our intention to clarify the unique selling proposition of natural diamonds to the broadest possible audience.”
