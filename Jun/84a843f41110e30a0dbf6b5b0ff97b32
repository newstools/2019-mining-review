The excitement rises as hundreds of people gather for the event in Dubai. Not just in the auction theater but people also join from all over the world via their computer. Bidders have seen what's for sale and have their eyes on the items they want. Perhaps they'll bid on other items if the price is right. The auction staff has been preparing the event for weeks and everything is ready to go. In the massive yard hundreds of excavators, wheel loaders, dozers, dump trucks, cranes and other equipment items are lined up waiting for their new owners. During the auction days everything is sold to the highest bidders. At Ritchie Bros.' previous auction in Dubai last March, more than 230 companies from the Middle East, Africa, India and other regions consigned and sold over 1,700 pieces of equipment. Over a thousand people registered to bid at the auction, including 170 new bidders and 570 bidders from abroad – including from Africa. These are massive events where supply and demand meet.
