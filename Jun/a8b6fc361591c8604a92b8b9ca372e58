Multi-listed Altus Strategies has defined a series of drill and trench targets at the its 100%-owned Djelimangara and Sebessounkoto Sud gold licences. The project is located 2 km east of the Altus’ Korali Sud licence, which hosts the Diba gold project and is approximately 20 km southeast of the multi-million ounce Sadiola gold mine in the ‘Kenieba Window’ gold belt in the west of the Republic of Mali. “Our detailed review of the historic data on the gold projects has defined a number of priority drill and trench targets," says CEO, Steven Poulton. "With a cumulative strike length of over 5.5 km the targets are often coincident with hard rock artisanal gold workings that can extend for up to 150 m in length with individual shafts reportedly down to 40 m. "The project contains over 20 km of strike in the prolific Senegal-Mali shear zone which hosts a number of current and former multi-million ounce gold mines including Sadiola and Yatela. "Altus will shortly commence detailed mapping around these prospects to further refine these targets. We look forward to updating shareholders in due course.” Highlights:
