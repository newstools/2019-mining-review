ASX-listed Golden Rim Resources has announced that completion of the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Lafi Gold. Lafi Gold’s Burkina Faso subsidiary owns the Margou Permit and is acquiring the Goueli Permit. Golden Rim’s MD, Craig Mackay, says: “The completion of this deal is transformational for Golden Rim. We have now quadrupled the area of Kouri and our control over the highly gold prospective Samira Hill Shear Zone has increased from 16 km to 40 km. "Our existing Mineral Resource looks to extend directly in the new permits so there is excellent potential to quickly expand the Resource. There’s also a good possibility for us to make new gold discoveries in the new permits, which are almost completely unexplored. "We’ve got some exciting first prospect areas to drill and we have already started drilling on the Granite Target. We look forward to updating the market on the results as they become available.” Highlights:
