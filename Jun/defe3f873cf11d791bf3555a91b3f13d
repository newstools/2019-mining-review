Multi-listed Kenmare Resources has announced the results of the DFS for the relocation of its Wet Concentrator Plant B to the Pilivili ore zone at its Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Kenmare MD, Michael Carvill, says: “The results of the DFS confirm our plans for relocating WCP B to Pilivili. Kenmare is on track to deliver a 20% increase in production at Moma in Mozambique on a sustainable basis from 2021 and the move of WCP B to Pilivili will be the final step in achieving this goal. "Earlier this month we received the first of two environmental permits required for the relocation and we expect to receive the second in Q3 2019, with the construction of the purpose-built road commencing immediately thereafter. I look forward to providing further updates on our progress with this growth project during the coming 18 months.” Overview:
