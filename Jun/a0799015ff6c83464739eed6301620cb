Canadian gold miner Endeavour Mining has appointed Louis Irvine as its new CEO, effective 1 August 2019. Irvine will take over from Vincent Benoit, who is departing to
rejoin the La Mancha Group, Endeavour’s main shareholder. During his tenure at Endevour Mining since 2016, Benoit played a key role in building and executing our strategy by increasing the quality of the company’s portfolio through divestments and acquisitions, and in reshaping our balance sheet to fund the company’s growth. Irvine is a qualified chartered accountant with more than 24
years’ experience in the mining industry, with extensive expertise in finance,
accounting, treasury, strategy and business development. He has held a number of CFO roles at business units of leading
international mining companies including BHP Billiton, Xstrata, and Anglo
American. Prior to joining Endeavour Mining, Irvine was executive head of
strategy and business development for base metals at Anglo American for six
years, and before that as the company’s CFO for Copper. “Irvine’s strong financial track record with leading international mining companies will be of significant benefit to Endeavour as we continue to grow,” says Endeavour Mining President and CEO Sébastien de Montessus. On 18 March this year,  Endeavour Mining poured first gold from its Ity CIL project in Côte d’Ivoire ahead of schedule and under-budget yielding approximately 1 800 oz of gold. The Ity CIL project is expected to extend mine life of the Ity project by 14 years, producing approximately 204 000 ozpa of gold for the first ten years, at a low all-in sustaining cost of $549/oz.
