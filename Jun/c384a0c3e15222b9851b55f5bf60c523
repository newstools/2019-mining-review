With South Africa’s carbon tax in force from 1 June this year, AfriSam is providing customers with transparent pricing and the ability to make greener choices. According to Richard Tomes, sales and marketing executive at AfriSam, the way the company complies with the new carbon tax is aimed at encouraging the appropriate behaviour of consumers. Rather than apply a blanket price increase, AfriSam is allocating the amount of carbon tax due on each bag of cement. The carbon tax is a levy that varies according to the amount of carbon emitted in the manufacture of a product. The different cement brands in AfriSam’s range contain varying amounts of clinker – the most energy-consuming element of cement. This means that the carbon footprints of the brands differ from each other. “We are taking a transparent and responsible approach to the new tax,” says Tomes. “By showing the amount of carbon tax payable on each specific bag of cement, our customers will still see the base price that we are charging. This avoids any confusion about how much of the final price is going toward the tax.” He notes that this approach will also make it easier for customers to identify the AfriSam cement brands with lower carbon footprints. “We believe that a tax should not just be a punitive tool, but it should also affect behaviour in society,” he says. “Just as cement producers are working hard to reduce carbon emissions, so the end-user can also play their part by choosing an environmentally-friendly brand.” While certain specialist cements demand higher
clinker content, he says AfriSam increasingly uses extenders to create
high-quality cement brands with lower environmental impact.
