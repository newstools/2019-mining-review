ASX/LSE-listed Resolute Mining has announced the Syama Underground Mine in Mali has achieved commercial rates of ore production having mined and hauled in excess of 80% of nameplate mine capacity. The Syama Underground Mine
will be the world’s first fully automated underground gold mine and at full
capacity will produce approximately 46,000 tonnes of ore per week, or 2.4 Mtpa,
using a fully integrated automated mine fleet. All key aspects of the mine in Mali are now operational with daily ore haulage rates regularly above 5,000 tonnes per day. Over the last week more than 38,500 tonnes of ore were mined and hauled. This level of mined and hauled tonnage is expected to be sustainable on a quarterly basis. Following commencement of
sublevel caving in December 2018, the key elements of the ramp up of the Syama
Underground Mine consist of infrastructure, development, and the automation
implementation program. MD and CEO, John Welborn, is
delighted to confirm Resolute continues to deliver on the Company’s important
strategic goals for 2019: “The Syama Underground Mine
will transform Resolute. Achievement of sustained rates of commercial
production from the world’s first fully automated underground gold mine is a
key milestone for Syama, for Resolute, and for the mining industry. “I congratulate the Syama project team, our operations team, and all our partners on this success. We are now focused on continuing the successful production ramp up to nameplate capacity and the completion of full automation of all aspects of the sublevel cave during 2019.”
