TSX and AIM listed West African gold producer Avesoro Resources restarted its open pit mining and gold processing plant operations at the Youga gold mine in Burkina Faso. This follows the suspension of operations at Youga on 12 June, after the operation’s open pit employees refused to work following the company’s announcement on 10 June that it was transitioning to contractor mining at both Youga and the New Liberty mine in Liberia. The move to a contract model is aimed at further reducing the mining cost at both mines whilst increasing mining volumes, the company said. Negotiations have now successfully
concluded between the Company’s proposed open pit mining contractor, Orkun
Group Sarl and former employees of the Company’s open pit mining department. Mining operations recommenced at
Youga on June 15, with processing operations recommencing on June 16, following
a period of building stockpiles. During the time that processing operations
were suspended at Youga, the company’s engineering team took the opportunity to
bring forward and complete various scheduled electrical and mechanical
maintenance tasks in and around the process plant. “My ongoing focus remains to minimise the impact of the temporary production stoppage at Youga, whilst successfully delivering the remaining transition to contractor mining operations at both Youga and New Liberty,” says Avesoro Resources CEO Serhan Umurhan. Meanwhile, Avesoro has revised its 2019 production guidance of 180 000 to 200 000 oz of gold, whilst assessing a number of project optimisation options, including ore sorting and heap leach scenarios at both New Liberty and Youga, with aims to further improve the economics of both projects.
