KEFI Minerals has received the last federal government consent for the financing and development of its Tulu Kapi Gold Project from the National Bank of Ethiopia. The National Bank of Ethiopia has now
provided its formal approval of the terms of the proposed full Project finance
package. KEFI and Tulu Kapi Gold Mines Share Company (TKGM) Chairman, Harry Anagnostaras-Adams, says: "KEFI would like to express its
appreciation of the enormous efforts by the Ministry of Finance, the Ethiopian
central bank and other authorities to establish regulatory frameworks to
oversee and support policies and actions being dealt with for the first time,
as the Tulu Kapi Gold Project is the first-mover in modern Ethiopian mining. "Likewise, we would like to thank the
consortium members for their patience and support as we work through the
compliance requirements of the various jurisdictions for this +US$200 million
funding package assembled at the Project level." As background: Whilst waiting for this central bank
confirmation letter and policy directive, KEFI has already obtained the two
other third party approvals required by the various interlinked arrangements: Implementation of financing can now flow
between the consortium members and the Project can also proceed on the ground
with the community and local authorities. The publicly guided development schedule
provides for a cautious build-up of site activities, whilst site security,
detailed engineering and the first small community resettlement are carefully
dealt with.
