ASX-listed Amani Gold has completed Phase One diamond core (DC) drilling operations at the Kebigada gold deposit located at its Giro gold project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. DRC – Amani Gold reported that drilling targeted deeper high-grade gold mineralisation within the central core of the Kebigada deposit. Drillhole GRDD034 was completed at 414.9 m with core samples submitted to SGS Mwanza laboratory (Tanzania). Assay results are expected soon. Drillhole GRDD035 completed at 546.5 m with core samples
selected for submission to SGS Mwanza laboratory. Assay results are expected
mid-November. The initial Phase One DC drillhole GRDD033 was abandoned at
a depth of 74.6 m due to significant deflection after crossing a fracture zone.
Total drilling completed in Phase One was 1,036 m. If significant gold mineralisation has been intersected in
Priority One holes, Phase Two drilling may comprise a further four core holes,
each 500 m in length. Read: Amani Gold keen to expand in the DRC About Giro The Giro gold project comprises two exploration permits covering a surface area of 497 km² and lies within the Kilo-Moto Belt of the DRC, a significant under-explored greenstone belt which hosts Randgold Resources’ 16 Moz Kibali group of deposits within 3 5km of Giro. The project area is underlain by highly prospective
volcano-sedimentary lithologies in a similar structural and lithological
setting as the Kibali gold deposits. Amani Gold has outlined a gold resource at Kebigada within Giro t of 45.62Mt @ 1.46g/t Au for 2.14Moz gold at a cut-off grade of 0.9g/t Au.
