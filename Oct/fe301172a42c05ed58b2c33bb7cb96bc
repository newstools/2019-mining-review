ASX-listed West African gold explorer Golden Rim Resources’ exploration campaign at the Kouri gold project in Burkina Faso is progressing well. Burkina Faso – The company’s major 21 000 m reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling programme has re-commenced with approximately 9 200 m of RC drilling and 4 000 m of diamond drilling (for approximately 100 holes) remaining to be drilled under the programme. In addition to the RC and diamond
drilling programme, an auger drilling programme and a ground magnetic and
gradient-array IP geophysical survey have also commenced. Diamond drilling at the Diabatou prospect The first diamond drill hole (MDH001)
at the Diabatou prospect, within the Margou permit, has been completed to a
depth of 80 m. MDH001 is a twin hole to previous RC drill hole MRC008 that
returned 7 m at 121.2 g/t gold from 41 m, including 1 m at 783.8 g/t gold from
44 m, and 3 m at 7.2 g/t gold from 56 m. MDH001 was planned to confirm the
orientation of this bonanza grade gold mineralisation prior to step-out
drilling. MDH001 intersected several zones of
granite-hosted quartz-sulphide mineralisation with visible gold. The first
assays from the re-commenced programme are expected in in the next few weeks. The next diamond drill hole at the Diabatou prospect (MDH002) is underway and has a planned depth of 160 m. MDH002 is designed to test the depth extent of the high grade mineralisation intersected in MRC008 along with the up-dip extent of a second zone of high grade mineralisation (4 m at 23.2 g/t gold from 67 m, including 1 m at 65.7 g/t gold) intersected in previous RC hole MRC014.

diamond drill holes are planned to the northeast and to the southwest to
determine the strike extent of the high grade gold mineralisation. Auger drilling An auger drilling programme that is expected to comprise 3 750 holes (total of ~15 000 m) has commenced at Kouri. Drilling is initially being conducted at the Diabatou prospect and will then extend to systematically cover various target areas in the newly acquired Margou permit.

expected with drilling being conducted on lines orientated at 1500. The line spacing
for the auger drilling at the Diabatou prospect is 200 m, with holes being
drilled every 50 m along the lines. Over other areas within the Margou permit
(including a number of interpreted cross-structure target areas) an initial 400
m line spacing, with holes every 50 m along the lines is planned. Geophysical survey A considerable ground magnetic and
gradient-array IP geophysical survey has commenced at the Diabatou prospect and
will be extended through the Margou and Goueli permits. The survey will be conducted over a 3 to 4 month period and comprises ~500 line km. It is being conducted on 100 m spaced lines.
