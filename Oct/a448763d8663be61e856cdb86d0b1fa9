MineRP and IsoMetrix have announced a formal partnership. These two mining-focused software companies have fast-expanding global customer bases and together offer the market an unmatched advantage in integrated risk and production management. The two
companies’ software products provide a combined ecosystem that facilitates
real-time management of risk, hazards and critical controls, underpinned by
three-dimensional spatial visualization. Empie Strydom, VP of Marketing at MineRP, says: “In the past risk was seen as a compliance function, but now we understand that risk management is a key component of a mining company’s performance and production. "The clearer – and more integrated – a view of risk the mine has, the more easily these risks can be managed and the lower its costs will be.” Paul Marketos, co-founder of IsoMetrix, adds: “The partnership with MineRP is a huge differentiator for us in the market. Our mining customers can now spatially visualize their EHS risks as they relate to production, in an integrated way. In most mines, the EHS function operates in isolation from production. "Our combined offering integrates EHS activities into production. For example, you can schedule safety inspections automatically on the back of production data that feeds directly into IsoMetrix. "The MineRP Short Interval Control solutions will ensure all daily tasks across EHS and production activities are scheduled and monitored.” Focusing on resource-based economies, both companies have offices in the Americas and Australia and are looking forward to bringing to these markets the benefits of a truly integrated approach to risk and productivity.
