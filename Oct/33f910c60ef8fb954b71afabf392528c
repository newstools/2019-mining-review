Epiroc has launched the Pit Viper 270 XC series stating that it delivers application flexibility, fuel-efficient performance and enhanced safety with outstanding operator comfort and ease of maintenance. The Pit Viper 270 series, a mining industry staple can now be configured with the XC package to provide 42.5 tons bit load capacity. Along with Epiroc's proven list of options, the perfect PV-270 XC can be configured for specific applications. The PV-270 XC takes the industry-leading Pit Viper 270 series to another level of productivity and reliability, ultimately contributing to the lowest total cost of ownership in the blast-hole drilling industry in its class. Epiroc’s PV-270 XC series delivers a hole diameter range up to 311 mm. This is available in both the multi pass and single pass offering which provides a clean hole of 16.8 m and 18 m. The PV-270 XC builds on the high industry standard of performance and innovation of the Pit Viper 270 series. Epiroc has worked towards understanding the customer needs to deliver “more venom” for your operation. With the Epiroc Rig Control System, the PV-270 XC can be run with an operator on-board using options such as AutoDrill and AutoLevel — or it can be run with the operator off the drill with the optional BenchREMOTE package, enabling one operator to run one or multiple units. It provides a foundation to add new functionality and options later without a major rebuild of the machine. Autonomous drilling can be implemented with almost no human interaction with the drill. “Since the first introduction of the Pit Viper 270 rig, Epiroc have successfully deployed over 500 Pit Viper 270 rigs in mining environments,” says Heino Hammann, product line manager at Epiroc Drilling Solutions.
