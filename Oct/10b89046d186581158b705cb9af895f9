ASX-listed Mali Lithium is to conduct a scoping study into the downstream processing of its Goulamina project in Mali. Mali – Mali Lithium has commissioned global engineering firm Hatch to assist with a scoping study into the downstream processing of the 6% Li2O product to be produced from its 100% owned project. Following discussions with downstream producers and potential customers, the company has identified an opportunity to produce highly sought products – lithium sulphate and lithium oxide – that could be more easily refined than the final lithium carbonate or hydroxide products on site at the Goulamina mine. These can be considered as ‘intermediary’ downstream products that can then be converted into the final, more technically difficult to produce battery grade lithium carbonate or hydroxide in existing conversion plants in China or at new chemical facilities in Europe. In addition to realising a premium price for these products, the potential to produce it on site could significantly reduce overall product transport costs for the project because of their lower volume compared with spodumene concentrate.

The scoping study will be completed in parallel with the ongoing DFS that is underway for the mining and processing required to produce the base case 6% spodumene concentrate from the project. Commenting on the downstream processing scoping study, MD Chris Evans said: “This is an exciting, low cost opportunity to investigate an alternative downstream processing option that has the potential to add significant further value to the Goulamina Project. “As we progress the DFS for Goulamina, we are continuing to investigate and evaluate a range of options to maximise value for our shareholders.”
