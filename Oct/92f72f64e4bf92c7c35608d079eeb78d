ASX / TSX-listed Perseus Mining has proposed to strengthen its board of directors with the appointment of David Ransom to the role of non-executive director. Perseus
Mining’s chairman, Sean Harvey says: “It will be with pleasure that we welcome a person of the calibre of Dave to the role of non-executive director on Perseus’ board. “He has relevant work experience gained over many years in the international mining business and with first class professional qualifications to match, his skills set, and his knowledge perfectly complement those of the current members of our board. Perseus secures cash to advance development of Yaouré “Given his outstanding skills and experience in the fields of exploration and geology combined with his deep knowledge of the mining industry globally, his appointment will be very timely in terms of Perseus Mining’s strategy of focusing on organic growth as the primary means of replacing and expanding its significant Reserve inventory. Ransom’s appointment will bring the total number of directors serving on Perseus’s board to six, including five independent, non-executive directors. With
professional qualifications including a Bachelor of Science (First Class
Honours), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) (Structural Geology), Ransom has
directly managed exploration programmes for a range of companies in Australia
and in Canada and served as a highly regarded independent consultant to the
global mining industry for many years. More recently, Ransom has performed the role of Resource Analyst / Portfolio Manager with responsibility for the Materials and Energy portfolio at the highly successful microcap investment fund, Acorn Capital. Ransom
has stepped away from his executive position at Acorn, providing time to resume
an active role in the industry. Apart from his academic knowledge and global industry experience, Ransom has previously served as a director of a number of ASX and TSX companies during the course of his career and is extremely well qualified in all respects to contribute positively to the governance of Perseus Mining through this appointment to the board of directors.
