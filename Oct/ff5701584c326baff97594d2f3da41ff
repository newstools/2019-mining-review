ASX-listed Predictive Discovery has received binding commitments for a placement to raise up to $1,750,000 through a placement of up to 175 million new shares. The placement was backed by a $250,000
cornerstone commitment by Capital DI and was also supported by several other
large shareholders, as well as several new professional and sophisticated investors. Upon close of the Placement it is
expected that Capital DI’s shareholding will increase to 14.08%. Predictive Discovery will undertake a Share Purchase Plan to raise up to $500,000 on the same terms as the Placement. “We are delighted with the strong interest shown in this capital raising. We are very happy to again enjoy Capital DI’s strong support of Predictive’s West African exploration through this placement,” comments MD, Paul Roberts. Predictive Discovery granted new permit in Cote d’Ivoire “We also thank existing shareholders who
have supported the offer, as well as a number of new shareholders that we welcome
