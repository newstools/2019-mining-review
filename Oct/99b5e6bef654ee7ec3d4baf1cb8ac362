On 21 October 2019 an armed gang gained entry to DRDGOLD's ERGO gold plant in South Africa, in the process fatally wounding chief security officer Bart Coetzee during an exchange of gun fire. The gang escaped with a quantity of calcine concentrate, estimated to contain up to 17 kg of gold. A large part of the gold containing concentrate was recovered by the South African Police Service in the investigation following the incident. Production figures Gold production increased by 5% quarter on quarter primarily due to a 4% increase in tonnage throughput as Far West Gold Recoveries achieved the planned throughput of 500 000 tpm from Phase 1 during the quarter and successfully started operating its mills at the beginning of September 2019.

2% decrease in cash operating cost per kilogram of gold sold and cash operating
cost per ton of material processed respectively, compared to the previous
quarter. Overall yield increased by 1% compared to the previous quarter due mostly to improved head grade at Ergo Mining. Adjusted EBITDA more than
doubled for the quarter, due mainly to the 15% increase in gold price received and
a 6% increase in gold sold. All-in sustaining costs
per kilogram and all-in costs per kilogram for the quarter were 11% and 9% higher
respectively, due to the positive impact of the change in estimate of
environmental rehabilitation recognised in profit or loss, lowering the
comparative unit costs of the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents
increased to R333.6 million as at 30 September 2019 (30 June 2019: R279.5 million),
after paying a cash dividend of R136.4 million (declared for the year ended 30
June 2019) and increasing working capital lockup by R133.9 million for the
quarter.
