Each of the Azumah Directors who hold or control shares intend to accept the Increased Offer in relation to those shares in the absence of a superior proposal. Read more about gold mining Azumah Chairman Michael Atkins says: “The Increased Offer was a good result for shareholders, given the significant premium offered to the Azumah share price immediately prior to the Offer being announced, as well as being a premium to the implied value per Azumah share represented by the recent minority 4% interest earn-in transaction entered into with Ibaera in respect to the Wa Gold Project. “The
Increased Offer price and consequent premium paid to Azumah shareholders is one
we believe to be a fair recognition of both Azumah and Ibaera’s respective
control over the development of the Wa Gold Project through the existing joint
venture arrangements, particularly where key decisions over future progress
require the unanimous agreement of both parties “We recognise that some shareholders may have preferred to realise the ultimate vision of successfully bringing the Wa Gold Project into production but after balancing the increased price now on offer for shares against the inherent future risks of successfully completing financing, construction and entering into steady state production, as a Board we unanimously believe that accepting the Increased Offer is the best path forward for shareholders.” In
connection with increasing the Offer, Ibaera has agreed to shorten the payment
terms to 10 business days after acceptance of the Increased Offer. The Increased Offer is now scheduled to close at 7.00pm (Sydney time) on 3 December 2019, unless extended.
