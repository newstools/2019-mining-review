AIM-listed diamond producer Firestone Diamonds says intermittent power supply at its 75%-owned Liqhobong mine in Lesotho has resulted in production disruptions. The Liqhobong mine is supplied electricity from the Muela
Hydropower Station (MHS) which is owned by the Lesotho Electricity Company and
which forms part of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project Phase 1 Katse Dam. The MHS commenced a two-month maintenance shutdown on 1 October at which time ongoing supply was to be provided by Eskom, South Africa's power utility company. Since then, the mine experienced unexpected voltage fluctuations that caused the drives of the plant equipment to trip and as a result, operations have been severely disrupted. Management is addressing the issue urgently with the LEC and Eskom, and will provide further updates in due course.
