Queensland-based technology startup GlassTerra is collaborating with a global satellite connectivity company to conduct a pioneering proof of concept safety project to monitor a key embankment in real-time at Mount Morgan. Mount Morgan is an abandoned mine managed by the Queensland Government’s Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. GlassTerra has installed one of its Internet of Things (IoT) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors at Mount Morgan to demonstrate the safety benefits of real-time tailings embankments monitoring. The collaboration will showcase the integration of this technology with GlassTerra's geospatial platform and global satellite connectivity to achieve highly reliable real-time monitoring of tailings embankments.

Chief Customer Officer, Sophia Li, said that the
combined solution will demonstrate the ability to conduct real-time monitoring
of unplanned movements of earth and other parameters, on embankments such as
tailings facilities. “Real-time
monitoring of embankments enables prompt reporting, investigation and
mitigation of any changes, which can enhance safety, improve the protection of
our environment and advance the social performance of the mining industry,” Li
said. It
also has potential application to the 3,500 tailings storage facilities in the
global mining sector. As testament to the project’s impact, it has already assisted
GlassTerra in securing a contract for real-time tailings embankments monitoring
in Africa. Interested in hearing more about the Mount Morgan Proof of Concept project? GlassTerra is exhibiting at the International Mining and Resources Conference and Expo (IMARC) from 29-31 October 2019 at the Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre in the Ascent Village.
