Predictive Discovery closed its Share Purchase Plan (SPP) on 25 November 2019, having received applications for 19,850,000 fully paid ordinary shares in the company. Paul Roberts, MD Predictive Discovery comments: “With completion of the SPP and approval of the second tranche of the recent placement, Predictive has now raised a total of $1.948 million. "These funds will enable us to drill the promising gold targets we are developing across our 100%-owned portfolio in Guinea, and support our equity contributions to the Resolute Joint Venture in Cote D’Ivoire, which returned very encouraging drill results in the June and September Quarters." This raised $198,500 and brought total funds raised in the past six weeks, including the recent $1.75 million placement commitment, to $1.95 million. Shares subscribed for under the SPP will be issued today, with the tranche 2 placement shares being issued following settlement on 4 December 2019. Predictive Discovery will issue one Option for every two shares subscribed for in the SPP with an exercise price of $0.018 per Option and an expiry date which is 3 years from the date of issue. The number of Options to be issued pursuant to the SPP will be 9,925,000. It is the intention of  Predictive Discovery to seek quotation of the Options having exceeded the 50 subscriber threshold. A Prospectus and Application Form for the Options will be despatched on or about 9 December 2019 to shareholders who subscribed for shares under the placement and the SPP.
