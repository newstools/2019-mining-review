TSX-listed IAMGOLD Corporation’s feasibility study at its Burkina Faso-based Essakane operation supports an increase in current hard rock carbon-in-leach plant capacity and outlines an economically viable heap leach facility at the end of CIL operations. READ MORE: About IAMGOLD The capital cost of the HL
facility was reduced by $40 million, for the new scenario, by re-using existing
CIL plant equipment (primary & secondary crushing circuits) at the end of
CIL life and by optimising the heap leach pad footprint. The optimisation of the heap
leach pad footprint allows for the HL infrastructure to remain within the
current industrial complex of the mine, versus the PFS scenario which would
have required additional land outside of the current complex, thus avoiding
impact to communities and farmland. Steve Letwin, President and CEO of IAMGOLD, commented: “With our self-funding lens
in place, the IAMGOLD team reviewed the CIL/HL feasibility study and produced a
robust, low cost plan with optionality in the future. I would like to thank our
COO Gord Stothart, his project team and our consultants for their excellent
work in defining the future plan for Essakane.” The FS was completed by
IAMGOLD, with inputs from technical studies completed by other consultants, and
has an effective date of 6 November 2019. The FS represents a
comprehensive study of the technical and economic viability of a mineral
project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method has been
established and an effective method of mineral processing has been determined. IAMGOLD is using the FS to support a $9 million investment in the current plant to improve its capacity to 11.7 Mtpa (at 100% hard rock equivalent capacity) and plan for a heap leach facility to be deployed in 2027.
