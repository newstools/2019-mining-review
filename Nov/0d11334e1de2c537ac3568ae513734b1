Those employees whose remuneration falls below the entry level minimum wage after the application of the above increases, will receive upward salary adjustments. Other areas of improvement will be in the medical aid and housing allowances which will increase in line with repayments of the homes at employee housing estates. Both parties have agreed that a review will be undertaken in Year 3 to ensure that increases for the remaining two years are in line with the Consumer Price Index prevailing at that time.
