Minerals has announced that its subsidiary, Tulu Kapi Gold Mines (TKGM) has
launched the company’s Tulu Kapi Gold Project with its Ethiopian private and
public sector partners. The
project has gained significant momentum in recent weeks and, after many
unfortunate delays, is ready for the start of development. It is supported by all consortium members and the Ethiopian Government
at all levels. KEFI and TKGM’s Executive Chairman, Harry Anagnostaras-Adams, says: “I
am delighted that the project has reached this stage, after so many delays and
setbacks as the country and the sector were going through quite an amazing
change. “We have shared the frustrations of our shareholders and our partners, but I now believe the project has encouraging momentum. As first mover for modern mining in Ethiopia, we have done the heavy lifting with the authorities and the community and we can now all share the benefits as we advance.
