A consortium
representing Chinese, French and Singaporean interests has won a tender to
develop the northern area of Simandou in Guinea. Guinea – The SMB-Winning
Consortium led by Singaporean Winning International Group and Guinea’s Société Minière de Boké is now
officially the “Temporary Selected Eligible Bidder” to develop blocks 1 and 2
of Simandou, one of the world’s largest untapped iron ore deposits. SMB-Winning Consortium is currently Guinea’s largest bauxite developer. Through the consortium’s efforts, the country has become the world’s largest exporter of bauxite in just four years. Sun Xiushun, chief commander of Guinea’s SMB-Winning
Consortium stated, “This is incredibly exciting news. We were successful in the
creation of the largest bauxite project in Guinea, and now we hope to be even
more innovative, more environmentally friendly and efficient in developing
blocks 1 and 2 of Simandou. “Through mining, railway construction, port construction,
and community development, we will once again build a mining project with a
capacity of 60 million to 80 million tons. This will greatly benefit Guinea and
its people, which is the commitment SMB-Winning Consortium has made to change
and develop the country.” Read: Simandou’s stumbling block Limitless untapped potential Located approximately 650 km southeast of Guinea’s capital city, Conakry,   Simandou is one of the world’s largest untapped and richest high-grade iron ore deposits. It is an open-pit mine with estimated reserves of billions of tons. In March this year, the Guinean government reached a settlement agreement with Israel’s BSGR and successfully regained blocks 1 and 2 of Simandou. The Guinean government has stated that the ore from Simandou must be exported through the railway and port within Guinea, requiring the construction of a new railway and port to Guinea’s coast, both within the boundaries of the country.
