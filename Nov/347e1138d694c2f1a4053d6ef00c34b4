Target for ArcGIS Pro is an industry-first tool that enhances mining integration of mining and exploration data. Released
this week, Target for ArcGIS Pro enables geoscientists
seamless integration of subsurface drilling and borehole data into ArcGIS Pro.
It was created to bring advanced understanding of mining and exploration
data to the powerful next-generation Esri ArcGIS Pro environment. The industry-first, intuitive Esri-integrated solution
simplifies the importing, viewing and analysis of drillhole and subsurface geological data within ArcGIS Pro to allow
geoscientists, geologists and GIS analysts to make timely decisions on project
viability and enable faster discoveries. Seequent’s GM Mining and
Minerals, Nick Fogarty, says: “We’ve
worked very closely with Esri to create essential workflows for geoscientists
in mining and exploration who want to use their data in  ArcGIS Pro. “Our partnership ensures we
can deliver interoperability that allows our customers to get the full benefit
from both Target and ArcGIS geoscience
workflows, creating a world-leading end to end solution. “Target for ArcGIS Pro is the latest in our ongoing effort to enhance
integration and empower advanced geoscience analysis within Esri’s established GIS platform.” Features Target for ArcGIS Pro allows users to:    • Import, visualise and interpret drilling data from standard industry data sources or generic formats.   • View drillhole data by numeric or categorical attributes in 2D maps and 3D scenes.   • Create cross sections to view and interpret your geology in 3D.   • Incorporate subsurface datasets to your project for increased understanding and geological context.• Navigate the subsurface quickly and easily using 3D navigation shortcuts. • Share and collaborate using Esri’s online workflows. Target for ArcGIS Pro is available as a free and licensed version.
