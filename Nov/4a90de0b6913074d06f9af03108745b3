LSE-listed Emmerson,
the Moroccan focused potash development company, this week announced an
upgraded JORC compliant mineral resource estimate (MRE) for its Khemisset
potash project in Northern Morocco, delivering a 72% increase in total resource. Morocco – The
updated MRE indicates Khemisset delivering a total resource to 537 million
tonnes of potash with an average grade of 9.24% K2O. Owned fully by Emmerson, Khemisset is a development stage potash project which, based on its scoping study, has a minimum mine life of 20 years, industry leading capital cost to production, bottom quartile delivered cost to customer, delivering average annual EBITDA of US$236 million and a post-tax NPV10 of $1.14 billion.

for completion Emmerson reports that project development continues to
progress exceptionally well and the feasibility study is on track for
completion in H1 2020. Hayden Locke, CEO of Emmerson, commented: “Following a
successful drilling campaign, it is pleasing to see the overall MRE tonnages
increase by over 70%, to more than half a billion tonnes. The recalculation of
the economic cut-off grade for Khemisset shows the project can be profitable to
a grade as low as 5.2% K2O and, as a result, we continue to believe there is
strong potential to increase the mine life at Khemisset. The updated MRE is a
further validation of the world class prospects for the project. “We continue to make exceptional progress on the feasibility
study and remain confident it will be delivered within our target timeline of
the first half of 2020. “The significant proportion of the MRE within the higher confidence Indicated resource category will support our ongoing discussions with various potential debt financing institutions which included an indicative proposal for up to $230 million of project finance debt from a major European commercial bank,” he concluded.
