ASX-listed Resource Generation has signed a binding Transportation of Coal Agreement for the purposes of delivering to 3.6 Mtpa of export quality coal to a Richards Bay Terminal on a ‘take or pay’ basis. Containing 40% of South
Africa’s coal reserves, the Waterberg is the next viable coal field in South
Africa. Consistent with the South African Government’s national strategic imperative [Strategic Infrastructure Projects (SIP) 1 of the National Development Plan – i.e. unlocking the Northern Mineral Belt using the Waterberg as a catalyst], Transnet has the Waterberg rail capacity expansion process with the Revised Stage 2-3 of the Waterberg Expansion Programme already underway. Waterberg growth inbound as R12 billion water access project kicks off The expanded rail
capacity will ensure that coal from LCL’s Boikarabelo Coal Mine and other
future neighbouring mines is transported to the intended end users. Papi Molotsane, Interim
CEO said “this is an important milestone towards achieving financial close for
the Project” The key terms of the
Transport of Coal Agreement are set out below: Transnet: Upping its bulk commodity delivery capacity The Agreement also
provides for the recovery of the capital outlay for the NSF (Network
Stabilising Facility) on a per railed tonnage basis over the period 1 June 2022
to 31 March 2024. Any capital outlay not recovered through railings over this period will be forgone.
