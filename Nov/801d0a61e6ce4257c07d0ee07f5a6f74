Digger, a locally designed mobile recruitment app for the mining industry, was awarded the  Best Enterprise Solution Award at the 2019 MTN App of the Year awards, held in Johannesburg last week. Digger is a recruitment automation and content platform that enables employers and qualified job seekers to connect in the most efficient way, including shortlisting, continuous candidate communication on a content management system and built in applicant tracking system (ATS), all with no recruitment fees. Applicants benefit from niched industry specific jobs, automated feedback, and a one-stop shop with all the necessary information to make informed decisions when applying for a position. It also enables, through a secure private platform, for clients to be able to see a candidate’s profile, once they give consent, all on a Free Mobile App. Special Report: The future of mining “It's our passion to find the right candidates in a cost effective and time efficient manner, to match people, families and companies in a manner that builds careers, cultures and communities, “stated Digger’s Lindi Engelbrecht. “One of the biggest problems in the mining/resource sector is the lack of access and visibility to job opportunities. Digger is effectively using mobile to increase access, and therefore maximise the chances of jobseekers to find work. Winning the award, means more exposure for Digger, whereby we can build more relationships with businesses and drive real impact for the users.” Award entries in this category were all judged according to strict criteria, assessing whether they were a solution that specifically focusses on business and companies, whether as a locally developed app that focuses on customer relationship management, storage, utilities, business solutions and sales or e-Commerce.
