demonstrated by the government of Guinea in support of this project. We see

Read business as usual for graphite in 2020 A unique deposit The Lola graphite deposit is one of the largest surface graphite mineralization in the world, with an area of 3. 22 km2 of continuous graphite rich gneiss. It is located approximately 1 000 km South-East of Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea. The deposit is present at surface over 8.7 km, an average of 370 m wide. The first 20 to 50 m (average of 32 m) of the deposit is well weathered (lateralised), freeing graphite flakes from the silicate gangue and thus allowing for easy grinding and optimal recovery of all large and jumbo flakes. Over 50% of the graphite is large flake (+80mesh), and 26% is “jumbo” flake material (+50 mesh).
