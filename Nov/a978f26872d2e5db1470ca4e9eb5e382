JSE-listed MC
Mining has been granted a mining right for its 74% owned Generaal coking and
thermal coal project in the Limpopo province. Generaal Project, together with the Chapudi and Mopane projects, comprise MC Mining’s longer-term Greater Soutpansberg Project (GSP) in the Soutpansberg Coalfield. The GSP is located within close proximity to the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone an area designated by government to focus on, amongst others, energy and metallurgical industries. The company submitted mining right applications for the
three GSP project areas to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy
(DMRE) in 2013 and following the Chapudi mining right in December 2018, the
Generaal mining right is the second of the applications to be granted. Listen: The big debate: Renewables vs Coal Significant earning potential The Generaal Project contains over 407 million gross
tonnes in situ of inferred coal resources and supports MC Mining’s strategy of
being South Africa’s pre-eminent producer of hard coking coal, used in the
steel manufacturing process and attracting significantly higher sales prices
compared to thermal coal. David Brown, MC Mining’s Chief Executive Officer
commented: “The granting of the mining right is a further step in unlocking
value from MC Mining’s significant coking and thermal coal assets, positioning
the GSP to be a potential long-term coal supplier to industrial users both
local and offshore, including the planned Musina-Makhado SEZ. “The long-term development of the three GSP project areas is complementary to our flagship Makhado hard coking coal project, also in the Soutpansberg Coalfield. The company has made significant progress in advancing Makhado during the last 12 months and anticipates completing the Phase 1 capital raise process in the near-term in order to facilitate the commencement of construction in Q1 CY2020. “The conclusion of domestic and export Makhado Phase 1 and Phase 2 off-take agreements reflects the market appetite for hard coking coal and the significant potential of projects located in this coalfield.”
