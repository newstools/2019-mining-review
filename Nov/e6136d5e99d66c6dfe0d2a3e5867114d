Armadale Capital has confirmed that the mine design for its Mahenge Liandu
graphite project, Tanzania, is now being finalised for inclusion in the
Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). Tanzania – The announcement following a site visit by the project engineer, tasked with designing the graphite mine. Armadale says that the mine design will be optimised to ensure high grade areas are targeted first ensuring stronger cash flow generation in the early years. The project engineer has reviewed the site layout
to garner a primary understanding of the logistics, terrain and route to market.
All assumptions for the DFS have now been stress tested and verified Armadale
director Nick Johansen said: “Over
the past six months, significant progress has been made defining a high-grade
resource, completing MOUs and progressing the commercialisation strategy. With
our funding position now secure, the Board is delighted to continue progressing
Armadale’s ongoing transition from explorer to emerging producer. “We are now looking
beyond the completion of the DFS to focus on the commercialisation strategy in
order to deliver a high-quality graphite product to our off-take partners.” Read: Strong demand for Mahenge Liandu graphite About Mahenge Liandu Armadale’s wholly-owned Mahenge Liandu Graphite
Project, located in a highly prospective region in Tanzania, has a high-grade
JORC compliant inferred, indicated and measured mineral resource estimate of  59.5Mt at 9.8% TGC. This includes 15.90Mt
inferred at 9.75% TGC, 32.06Mt indicated at 9.58% TGC and 11.52MT measured at
10.54% TGC making it one of the largest high-grade resources in Tanzania. Previous work at the project has demonstrated Mahenge Liandu’s potential as a commercially viable deposit, with significant tonnage, high-grade coarse flake and near surface mineralisation (implying a low strip ratio) contained within one contiguous ore body.
