ASX-listed graphite miner Syrah Resources has produced its first purified spherical graphite from its battery anode material plant in Louisiana, USA using natural graphite from its Mozambique-based Balama project. This represents the achievement of a significant milestone at Syrah’s battery anode material (BAM) project, and is the execution of the company’s strategy of developing a vertically integrated natural graphite anode material production capability. Moving forward, internal process optimisation, product testing and quality control assessment will continue in the coming weeks in preparation for qualification products to be dispatched to target customers.

Syrah Resources says: “The Balama graphite
operation’s expected scale, quality and low production cost at full capacity
are key enablers in the delivery of Syrah's integrated BAM strategy.” “With the completion of
construction and commissioning activities for initial production of purified spherical
graphite from Vidalia in the USA, we are demonstrating a pathway to produce
value-added products at commercial scale, focussed on establishing a core
position in the battery supply chain.” “This is a significant step forward for Syrah in providing an alternative and complementary source of ex-China BAM supply, demonstrating our commitment to develop the first large-scale fully integrated natural graphite anode material production facility outside of China.” LEARN MORE: About Syrah Resources
